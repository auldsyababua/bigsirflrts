## Security & Authentication

### Advanced Prompt Injection Protection with User Scoping

**Priority:** High (Post-MVP Phase 2) **Description:** Implement comprehensive
prompt injection protection for the Telegram task creation workflow using
LLMGuard or similar security framework, combined with a user scoping system that
limits the blast radius of malicious content based on user privilege levels and
data isolation boundaries.

**Current State:** Basic input validation only (length limits, basic content
filtering). All users operate at same privilege level with access to shared
data.

**Requirements:**

**Security Framework:**

- Integrate LLMGuard or equivalent prompt injection detection
- Implement content filtering for malicious patterns
- Add monitoring and alerting for detected injection attempts
- Create fallback workflows for blocked inputs

**User Scoping & Privilege System:**

- **User Risk Levels**: Define user categories (Guest, Employee, Supervisor,
  Admin) with different UGC risk tolerances
- **Data Isolation Boundaries**: Implement scoped access where certain user
  levels can only affect their own data or team-specific elements
- **Privilege-Based Processing**: Different prompt processing strictness based
  on user level (e.g., Guests get maximum filtering, Admins get minimal
  filtering)
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Ensure malicious prompts can only affect the
  user's own tasks/data, not system-wide or other users' data

**Scoping Schema Design (Future Planning):**

- User-specific task namespaces
- Team-based data segregation
- Role-based prompt processing policies
- Graduated privilege escalation system
- Cross-user impact prevention mechanisms

**Security Isolation Examples:**

- Guest users: Can only create/modify their own tasks, heavy prompt filtering
- Field employees: Can affect team tasks but not other teams, moderate filtering
- Supervisors: Can affect department-wide tasks, light filtering
- Admins: System-wide access with audit logging, minimal filtering

**ERPNext Implementation:**

- Use ERPNext's native Role Permission system for data isolation
- Custom Permission Rules for row-level security
- Custom validation scripts with LLMGuard integration
- Server script to enforce privilege-based prompt filtering

**Context:** Identified during Story 1.3 security review. Current MVP approach
uses trusted user base and basic validation, but production deployment requires
comprehensive protection against prompt injection attacks AND a way to limit the
damage scope based on user privilege levels and data ownership boundaries.

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sprints (2 for security framework, 1-2 for scoping
system) **Dependencies:** LLMGuard integration, monitoring infrastructure, user
management system redesign, ERPNext permission configuration
