- Which features map to FLRTS needs
- Screenshots of key workflows
- List of any missing features that require custom development

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ERPNext dev instance deployed and accessible (10N-228)
- [ ] ERPNext connected to Supabase (10N-229)
- [ ] FSM module enabled in ERPNext instance

## Template Structure
