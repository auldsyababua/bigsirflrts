## Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Hardcoded Secrets in Documentation

**Frequency:** 3 occurrences across 2 PRs **Agent Responsible:** Action Agent
**Category:** SECURITY **Priority:** CRITICAL

**Examples:**

1. **PR #150** - `docs/setup/telegram-webhook-configuration.md:20`
   - Hardcoded `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` value exposed in documentation
   - **Root Cause:** Agent wrote actual secret value to documentation instead of
     referencing environment variable
   - **Commits to Fix:** 1 commit (99b1a82)
   - **Severity:** 10/10 (CodeRabbit)

2. **PR #151** - `.claude/hooks/send_event.py:76`
   - JSON parse error exits with status 1 instead of graceful failure
   - **Root Cause:** Error handling doesn't follow "best-effort" design pattern
   - **Commits to Fix:** 1 commit (392d06e)
   - **Severity:** Major

3. **PR #107** - `docs/reference/frappe-cloud-ssh-access-for-agents.md:171`
   - Command shows site_config.json secrets unmasked despite section title
     claiming masking
   - **Root Cause:** Documentation example uses `cat` instead of `jq` to redact
     secrets
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Critical

**Root Cause:** Action Agent lacks explicit guidance to:

1. Never write actual secret values to documentation files
2. Always use placeholder patterns like `<SECRET>`, `$ENV_VAR`, or
   `***REDACTED***`
3. Verify documentation examples don't leak credentials

**Current Prompt Gap:** The Action Agent prompt doesn't have a dedicated
"Security Checklist" section that enforces:

- Secret detection before committing documentation
- Environment variable referencing patterns
- Example command sanitization

**Proposed Prompt Addition:**

````markdown
## Security Requirements

### Documentation Security Checklist

Before creating or modifying any documentation file, verify:

1. **Secret Detection:**
   - [ ] No API keys, tokens, passwords, or webhook secrets are hardcoded
   - [ ] Use placeholders: `<SECRET>`, `$ENV_VAR_NAME`, or `***REDACTED***`
   - [ ] Check for patterns: `_key=`, `_secret=`, `_token=`, `password=`

2. **Example Command Sanitization:**
   - [ ] Any `cat`, `echo`, or `curl` examples that display config files use
         redaction
   - [ ] Prefer:
         `jq 'with_entries(if .key|test("secret|password|key|token") then .value="<REDACTED>" else . end)'`
   - [ ] Document that secrets are masked in examples

3. **Environment Variable References:**
   - [ ] Instead of: `WEBHOOK_SECRET=wh_tg_flrts_abc123`
   - [ ] Use: `WEBHOOK_SECRET` (stored in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

4. **Pre-Commit Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Run before git commit:
   grep -r -E "(secret|password|token|key)\s*=\s*['\"]?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{20,}" docs/
   ```
````

**Enforcement:** If any security check fails, STOP and request guidance from
Planning Agent.

### Pattern 2: User-Specific Absolute Paths in Documentation

**Frequency:** 4 occurrences across 3 PRs
**Agent Responsible:** Action Agent
**Category:** DOCUMENTATION
**Priority:** HIGH

**Examples:**

1. **PR #107** - `docs/prompts/action-agent.md:139`
   - Hardcoded path: `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/bigsirflrts`
   - **Root Cause:** Agent copied local absolute path instead of using repo-relative reference
   - **Commits to Fix:** Addressed in PR #107 review comments

2. **PR #106** - `docs/prompts/browser-agent.md:1`
   - Repository path: `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/bigsirflrts`
   - **Root Cause:** Same as above
   - **Commits to Fix:** Fixed in commit e8a9f47

3. **PR #106** - `docs/prompts/browser-agent.md:145`
   - Screenshot save path: `~/Desktop/bigsirflrts/docs/.scratch/`
   - **Root Cause:** Used absolute path instead of `docs/.scratch/`
   - **Commits to Fix:** Fixed in commit e8a9f47

4. **PR #149** - Multiple documentation files
   - Various references to `/Users/colinaulds/...` paths
   - **Root Cause:** Pattern repeated across multiple prompt files

**Root Cause:**
Action Agent doesn't have guidance to:
1. Detect user-specific paths (`/Users/`, `/home/`, `C:\Users\`)
2. Convert absolute paths to repo-relative paths
3. Verify portability of documentation examples

**Current Prompt Gap:**
No documentation portability guidelines exist in the Action Agent prompt.

**Proposed Prompt Addition:**

```markdown
## Documentation Portability Requirements

### Path Reference Standards

When writing documentation or prompts that reference file paths:

1. **Repo-Relative Paths (Preferred):**
   - ✅ CORRECT: `docs/.scratch/<issue>/screenshots/`
   - ✅ CORRECT: `infrastructure/aws/lambda/`
   - ❌ WRONG: `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/bigsirflrts/docs/`
   - ❌ WRONG: `~/Desktop/bigsirflrts/infrastructure/`

2. **Generic Path References:**
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Save to the repository root"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Clone the repository locally"
   - ❌ WRONG: "at /Users/colinaulds/Desktop/bigsirflrts"

3. **Pre-Commit Path Check:**
   ```bash
   # Run before committing documentation:
   grep -r -E "(\/Users\/|\/home\/|C:\\\\Users\\\\)" docs/prompts/ docs/reference/
````

4. **Screenshot/Artifact Paths:**
   - Always use: `docs/.scratch/<issue>/` (no home directory prefix)
   - CLI examples: Use `./` or repo-relative paths only

**Enforcement:** If user-specific paths detected, convert to repo-relative
before committing.

### Pattern 3: SSH Configuration Security Issues

**Frequency:** 2 occurrences in 1 PR
**Agent Responsible:** Action Agent
**Category:** SECURITY / CONFIG
**Priority:** HIGH

**Examples:**

1. **PR #107** - `docs/reference/frappe-cloud-ssh-access-for-agents.md:282`
   - SSH config disables host key verification: `StrictHostKeyChecking no`
   - Uses: `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null`
   - **Root Cause:** Agent prioritized "ease of use" over security
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Major

2. **PR #107** - `docs/prompts/action-agent.md:139-176`
   - SSH examples lack heredoc pattern for non-interactive execution
   - Certificate validity wording inconsistent ("~6 hours" vs "6 hours from generation timestamp")
   - **Root Cause:** Documentation template didn't enforce security best practices
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Major

**Root Cause:**
Action Agent lacks SSH security guidelines and doesn't recognize insecure configurations.

**Current Prompt Gap:**
No SSH-specific security requirements in Action Agent prompt.

**Proposed Prompt Addition:**

```markdown
## SSH Configuration Security Requirements

### Secure SSH Patterns

When documenting SSH access or creating SSH configs:

1. **Host Key Verification (REQUIRED):**
   - ✅ CORRECT: `StrictHostKeyChecking yes` or `StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new`
   - ❌ WRONG: `StrictHostKeyChecking no`
   - ❌ WRONG: `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null`

2. **Known Hosts Management:**
   ```bash
   # Pre-populate known_hosts before first connection:
   ssh-keyscan -p 2222 hostname >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
````

3. **Non-Interactive SSH Execution:**
   - Use heredoc pattern to avoid hanging:

   ```bash
   ssh hostname bash -s << 'EOF'
   cd /path/to/app
   command here
   EOF
   ```

4. **Certificate-Based Auth:**
   - Document exact validity duration (not "~6 hours")
   - Example: "valid for 6 hours from generation timestamp"

**Enforcement:** SSH configs that disable host key verification require explicit
security warning and justification.

### Pattern 4: Git Ignore and Artifact Tracking Issues

**Frequency:** 3 occurrences across 2 PRs
**Agent Responsible:** Action Agent
**Category:** CONFIG
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Examples:**

1. **PR #107** - `docs/prompts/reference_docs/action-agent-workflow-gates.md:184`
   - Gate 3 type-check evidence path inconsistent
   - Docs say: `.tsc-check.log` (repo root)
   - Script expects: `docs/.scratch/$ISSUE/tsc-check.log`
   - **Root Cause:** Documentation and enforcement script out of sync
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Major

2. **PR #107** - `security-findings.json:8`
   - `files_reviewed` count dropped from 95 to 2
   - **Root Cause:** Metadata not updated correctly
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Major (compliance concern)

3. **PR #106** - `flrts_extensions/flrts_extensions/patches.txt`
   - Added placeholder files without .gitignore rules
   - **Root Cause:** No guidance on when to add .gitignore rules

**Root Cause:**
Action Agent doesn't verify:
1. Documentation matches enforcement script requirements
2. Artifact path consistency across gate docs and scripts
3. Metadata files are updated correctly

**Current Prompt Gap:**
No "documentation/code consistency" verification step exists.

**Proposed Prompt Addition:**

```markdown
## Documentation-Code Consistency Verification

### Before Committing Documentation Changes

If documentation describes file paths, commands, or enforcement rules:

1. **Path Consistency Check:**
   - [ ] Documentation paths match actual script/tool expectations
   - [ ] Example: If gate script checks `docs/.scratch/$ISSUE/tsc-check.log`,
         documentation must reference the same path (not `.tsc-check.log`)

2. **Enforcement Script Alignment:**
   - [ ] Read the actual enforcement script referenced in documentation
   - [ ] Verify documented paths/patterns match script's file checks
   - [ ] Update either docs or script to align if mismatch found

3. **Metadata Update Verification:**
   - [ ] If security-findings.json or similar metadata exists, update counts
   - [ ] Verify `files_reviewed` count matches actual files changed
   - [ ] Don't decrease counts unless re-audit was actually performed

4. **Artifact .gitignore Rules:**
   - [ ] New scratch directories: add to .gitignore or document why tracked
   - [ ] Example: `docs/.scratch/*/screenshots/**/*.png` should be ignored

**Enforcement:** Run a diff check between documented paths and script file path references before committing.

### Pattern 5: Dangerous Shell Alias in Documentation

**Frequency:** 1 occurrence in 1 PR **Agent Responsible:** Action Agent
**Category:** SECURITY **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Examples:**

1. **PR #107** - `docs/prompts/reference_docs/agent-audit-checklist.md:30`
   - Shell alias includes: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
   - **Root Cause:** Agent documented convenience alias without security warning
   - **Commits to Fix:** Not yet fixed
   - **Severity:** Major

**Root Cause:** Action Agent doesn't flag security-weakening flags in documented
examples.

**Proposed Prompt Addition:**

````markdown
## Security-Weakening Flags

When documenting commands or aliases that include security-weakening flags:

**Prohibited Without Explicit Warning:**

- `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- `--no-verify` (git hooks)
- `--insecure` (curl)
- `-k` (curl)
- `--allow-root`

**Required Warning Format:**

```markdown
⚠️ **Security Warning:** This command uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
which bypasses safety controls. Only use in controlled environments. Prefer
normal permission flow in production.
```
````

**Enforcement:** Any command with security-weakening flags MUST include warning
block.

**Observation:** QA Agent caught the webhook secret issue but only after it was committed.

**Proposed Improvement:**

```markdown
## Pre-Merge Security Scan

Before approving any PR for merge:

1. **Secret Scan:**
   ```bash
   # Check for common secret patterns in docs:
   grep -r -E "(secret|password|token|key)[\s]*=[\s]*['\"]?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{20,}" docs/
````

2. **Path Portability Check:**

   ```bash
   # Check for user-specific paths:
   grep -r -E "(\/Users\/|\/home\/|C:\\\\Users\\\\)" docs/
   ```

3. **Fail Review If Found:**
   - Return to Action Agent with specific file:line references
   - Request fixes before re-review

**Enforcement:** Do not approve PR if security scan detects issues.

````

**Where to Add:** `docs/prompts/qa-agent.md` - Section: "Code Review Checklist" (expand existing)

**Priority:** HIGH

### Planning Agent

**Issues Found:** 0 direct issues

**Observation:** Planning Agent doesn't appear in review comment chain, suggesting handoff instructions may not emphasize security validation.

**Proposed Improvement:**

```markdown
## Security Validation in Work Block Planning

When planning work that involves:
- Documentation creation/updates
- Configuration file changes
- Script modifications
- SSH/credential setup

**Include Security Acceptance Criteria:**

Example work block:
```yaml
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] No hardcoded secrets in documentation (verified with grep scan)
  - [ ] All paths are repo-relative (no /Users/ or /home/ paths)
  - [ ] SSH configs use StrictHostKeyChecking yes (no disabled verification)
  - [ ] Security scan passes before QA handoff
````

**Enforcement:** Planning Agent must include security acceptance criteria for
any docs/config work.

```

**Where to Add:** `docs/prompts/planning-agent.md` - Section: "Work Block Format" (expand acceptance_criteria guidance)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

### Tracking Agent

**Issues Found:** 0 issues

**No Action Required** - Tracking Agent not involved in code review issues.
