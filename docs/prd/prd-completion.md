### OpenProject Integration Check ✓

- ✅ Custom fields support documented in FR5
- ✅ Work package types covered in FR11
- ✅ API v3 integration specified in Technical Assumptions
- ✅ Authentication approach defined using API keys/OAuth
- ✅ Project structure mapping included in FR13

### Risk Assessment ✓

- ⚠️ **OpenAI API Dependency**: Mitigated with fallback manual entry (FR10)
- ⚠️ **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: Addressed with custom vocabulary (Story 4.1)
- ⚠️ **Timezone Complexity**: Comprehensive test suite required (Story 2.3)
- ✅ **All critical risks have mitigation strategies**

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please initiate UX Design Architecture mode using this PRD as input. Focus on creating detailed wireframes for the confirmation dialog and universal input bar, as these are the most critical interaction points. The OpenProject integration should feel native while the FLRTS elements maintain their distinctive efficiency-focused character.

### Architect Prompt  

Please initiate Technical Architecture mode using this PRD as input. Priority considerations: design the NLP service for easy prompt iteration, ensure the OpenProject Gateway handles pagination efficiently, and architect the system for horizontal scaling as usage grows. The monorepo structure should support independent deployment of services.

### Immediate Actions for Development Team

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Provision OpenProject test instance with sample data
   - Obtain OpenAI API key and set up usage monitoring
   - Configure Google Cloud Speech-to-Text credentials

2. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Schedule PRD walkthrough with mining operations team
   - Validate timezone requirements with distributed team members
   - Confirm OpenProject custom fields with CEO/CFO

3. **Technical Spikes**
   - Test OpenProject API rate limits and pagination
   - Validate OpenAI function calling with complex inputs
   - Benchmark voice recognition in noisy environment

4. **Sprint Planning**
   - Epic 1 estimated at 1 sprint (2 weeks)
   - Epic 2 estimated at 2 sprints (4 weeks)  
   - Epic 3 estimated at 2 sprints (4 weeks)
   - Epic 4 estimated at 1 sprint (2 weeks)
   - **Total MVP Timeline: 12 weeks**

### Success Metrics Tracking

- Set up analytics pipeline before Epic 3 completion
- Establish baseline measurements for task creation time
- Create dashboard for real-time KPI monitoring
- Schedule monthly review of parsing accuracy

### Post-MVP Roadmap Considerations

- Integration with OpenProject's Gantt charts for visual planning
- Machine learning model for project categorization
- Expansion to support OpenProject's Agile boards
- Custom NLP model fine-tuning on company-specific terminology
- **Native AI Assistant via MCP**: Expose FLRTS as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, enabling any LLM to directly create/manage OpenProject tasks
- **OpenProject CLI Integration**: Leverage https://github.com/opf/openproject-cli for advanced automation and scripting capabilities
