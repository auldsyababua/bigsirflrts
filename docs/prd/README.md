## Quick Summary

**Product**: FLRTS (Fast Low-friction Repeatable Task System) **Purpose**:
Natural language task management layer for ERPNext FSM **Key Innovation**:
Conversational task creation with automatic timezone handling **Target Users**:
Distributed bitcoin mining operations team **Timeline**: 12-week MVP across 4
epics **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4o, ERPNext REST API, Frappe Cloud

## Key Decision: ERPNext on Frappe Cloud (Target Architecture)

This PRD describes the **target architecture** using **ERPNext Field Service
Management** (hosted on Frappe Cloud). **Migration status: Phase 1 complete**
(config layer, stub client), **Phase 2 pending** (live API integration).
OpenProject remains the default and functional backend.

Target ERPNext benefits:

- Industry-standard FSM workflows (service calls, maintenance, installations)
- Custom DocTypes for mining-specific metadata
- Managed MariaDB, Redis, and background workers
- Mature REST API and webhooks
- Git-based deployment for custom apps (flrts_extensions)

See [ADR-006](../architecture/adr/ADR-006-erpnext-frappe-cloud-migration.md) for
migration roadmap and 10N-243 for Phase 1 completion details.
