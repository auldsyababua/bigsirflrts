# Future Features

This document tracks features and enhancements that are planned for future development but not currently prioritized for the MVP or immediate sprints. This is the canonical location for recording post-MVP feature ideas and technical debt items.

## Security & Authentication

### Advanced Prompt Injection Protection with User Scoping
**Priority:** High (Post-MVP)
**Description:** Implement comprehensive prompt injection protection for the Telegram task creation workflow using LLMGuard or similar security framework, combined with a user scoping system that limits the blast radius of malicious content based on user privilege levels and data isolation boundaries.

**Current State:** Basic input validation only (length limits, basic content filtering). All users operate at same privilege level with access to shared data.

**Requirements:**

**Security Framework:**
- Integrate LLMGuard or equivalent prompt injection detection
- Implement content filtering for malicious patterns
- Add monitoring and alerting for detected injection attempts
- Create fallback workflows for blocked inputs

**User Scoping & Privilege System:**
- **User Risk Levels**: Define user categories (Guest, Employee, Supervisor, Admin) with different UGC risk tolerances
- **Data Isolation Boundaries**: Implement scoped access where certain user levels can only affect their own data or team-specific elements
- **Privilege-Based Processing**: Different prompt processing strictness based on user level (e.g., Guests get maximum filtering, Admins get minimal filtering)
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Ensure malicious prompts can only affect the user's own tasks/data, not system-wide or other users' data

**Scoping Schema Design (Future Planning):**
- User-specific task namespaces
- Team-based data segregation
- Role-based prompt processing policies
- Graduated privilege escalation system
- Cross-user impact prevention mechanisms

**Security Isolation Examples:**
- Guest users: Can only create/modify their own tasks, heavy prompt filtering
- Field employees: Can affect team tasks but not other teams, moderate filtering  
- Supervisors: Can affect department-wide tasks, light filtering
- Admins: System-wide access with audit logging, minimal filtering

**Context:** Identified during Story 1.3 security review. Current MVP approach uses trusted user base and basic validation, but production deployment requires comprehensive protection against prompt injection attacks AND a way to limit the damage scope based on user privilege levels and data ownership boundaries.

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sprints (2 for security framework, 1-2 for scoping system)
**Dependencies:** LLMGuard integration, monitoring infrastructure, user management system redesign, database schema updates for data isolation
