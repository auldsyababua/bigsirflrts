# Epic 3: Field Operations Integration

**Epic ID**: FLRTS-EP03
**Epic Name**: Field Operations Integration
**Epic Type**: Operational Enhancement

## Business Value Statement

As field operations managers and equipment coordinators, we need visibility into field reports, equipment status, and maintenance schedules within OpenProject's project management framework so that we can integrate operational field activities with overall project planning, resource allocation, and timeline management.

This epic transforms OpenProject from a simple task visualization tool into a comprehensive operations management platform that provides real-time insight into field activities, equipment utilization, and maintenance operations.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] Field reports are visible in OpenProject linked to relevant work packages and sites
- [ ] Equipment maintenance schedules appear as recurring work packages with proper resource allocation
- [ ] Equipment status and availability are tracked and visible for resource planning
- [ ] Field operations data integrates seamlessly with project timelines and Gantt charts
- [ ] Operations managers can identify bottlenecks and resource conflicts using OpenProject views

### Acceptance Criteria
- Field reports sync within 1 hour of creation in FLRTS
- Maintenance schedules create proper recurring work packages
- Equipment downtime is visible and impacts project timelines
- Field report attachments (photos, documents) are accessible from OpenProject
- Equipment utilization reports can be generated from OpenProject data
- Integration maintains FLRTS as operational SSOT while enhancing project visibility

## Technical Overview

### Entity Mapping Strategy

| FLRTS Entity | OpenProject Entity | Sync Pattern | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| field_reports | work_packages (type: report) | One-way → OP | Read-only in OP |
| equipment | assets OR custom work_packages | One-way → OP | Tracking only |
| maintenance_schedules | recurring work_packages | Bidirectional | Schedule updates from OP |
| equipment_assignments | work_package resources | One-way → OP | Resource planning |
| field_report_attachments | work_package attachments | One-way → OP | File sync required |

### Integration Patterns
1. **Field Reports**: One-way sync for visibility and project correlation
2. **Equipment Tracking**: Status and availability for resource planning
3. **Maintenance Scheduling**: Bidirectional for planning but execution tracked in FLRTS
4. **Resource Allocation**: Equipment assignments influence project resource planning

### Operational Workflow
```
Field Team → FLRTS → Sync Service → OpenProject → Project Manager
    ↓           ↓                                        ↓
Equipment    Reports                               Resource Planning
Maintenance  Status                                Timeline Impact

## Technical Implementation Details

### Field Report Work Package Schema
```typescript
interface FieldReportWorkPackage {
  id: number;
  subject: string; // Field report title/summary
  description: string; // Full field report content
  type: 'field_report';
  status: 'reported' | 'reviewed' | 'addressed' | 'closed';
  priority: number; // Mapped from report urgency
  assignee: number; // Report reviewer/handler
  project: number; // Site-based project
  customFields: {
    report_id: string; // FLRTS field_reports.id
    report_date: Date;
    personnel: string[]; // Field team members
    equipment_involved: string[];
    location: string; // GPS coordinates
    report_type: string; // Inspection, incident, maintenance, etc.
  };
  attachments: Attachment[]; // Photos, documents
}
```

### Equipment Resource Integration
```typescript
interface EquipmentResource {
  id: number;
  name: string; // Equipment name/identifier
  type: 'equipment';
  available: boolean; // Real-time availability
  location: string; // Current site location
  utilization: number; // Current utilization percentage
  maintenance_due: Date | null; // Next scheduled maintenance
  customFields: {
    equipment_id: string; // FLRTS equipment.id
    equipment_type: string;
    serial_number: string;
    last_maintenance: Date;
    condition: string; // Good, Fair, Needs Attention, Out of Service
  };
}
```

### Maintenance Schedule Recurring Work Package
```typescript
interface MaintenanceWorkPackage {
  id: number;
  subject: string; // "Maintenance: [Equipment] - [Type]"
  type: 'maintenance';
  recurring: {
    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'annually';
    interval: number;
    end_date?: Date;
  };
  estimated_hours: number; // From maintenance_schedules
  resources: string[]; // Required personnel and equipment
  customFields: {
    maintenance_schedule_id: string;
    equipment_id: string;
    maintenance_type: string; // Preventive, corrective, emergency
    required_certifications: string[];
    safety_requirements: string[];
  };
}
```

## Sync Architecture Considerations

### File Attachment Handling
1. **Storage Strategy**: Files remain in FLRTS/Supabase storage
2. **Reference Sync**: OpenProject stores references/URLs to FLRTS files
3. **Access Control**: OpenProject users access files through FLRTS authentication
4. **Caching Strategy**: Consider CDN or local caching for performance

### Real-time vs Batch Sync
- **Field Reports**: Near real-time (within 1 hour) for operational visibility
- **Equipment Status**: Real-time for accurate resource planning
- **Maintenance Schedules**: Daily batch sync sufficient for planning
- **File Attachments**: Lazy loading/on-demand sync

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### New Technical Debt
- File attachment sync adds complexity and storage considerations
- Recurring work package management may strain OpenProject
- Equipment resource modeling may require custom OpenProject fields
- Performance impact of increased sync volume needs monitoring

### Migration Considerations
- Historical field reports may create large initial sync volume
- Equipment data cleanup may be required before sync
- Maintenance schedule standardization needed for consistent recurring tasks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **File Sync Complexity**: Attachment synchronization is technically complex
- **Performance Impact**: Large volume of operational data may slow OpenProject
- **Data Volume**: Field operations generate high-volume, high-frequency data

### Medium Risks
- **User Interface Complexity**: Too much operational data may overwhelm project managers
- **Sync Latency**: Field operations need timely visibility of current status
- **Storage Costs**: File attachments may significantly increase storage requirements

### Low Risks
- **Equipment Data Quality**: Equipment data is typically well-structured
- **Maintenance Schedule Patterns**: Maintenance schedules follow predictable patterns

## Timeline Estimate

**Duration**: 5-6 sprints (10-12 weeks)

### Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1**: Field report basic sync (no attachments)
- **Sprint 2**: Equipment status and availability tracking  
- **Sprint 3**: Maintenance schedule recurring work packages
- **Sprint 4**: File attachment sync architecture and implementation
- **Sprint 5**: Advanced features (personnel certs, safety incidents)
- **Sprint 6**: Performance optimization, testing, monitoring
