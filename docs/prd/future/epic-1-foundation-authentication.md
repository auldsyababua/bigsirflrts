# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic ID**: FLRTS-EP01
**Epic Name**: Foundation & Authentication
**Epic Type**: Foundation

## Business Value Statement

As a field operations team, we need a robust synchronization infrastructure between our existing FLRTS system and OpenProject so that we can leverage OpenProject's project visualization capabilities while maintaining Supabase as our single source of truth for operational data.

This epic establishes the foundational sync infrastructure, authentication mechanisms, and webhook framework that will enable all future integration capabilities.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] Bidirectional authentication established between FLRTS (Supabase) and OpenProject
- [ ] Real-time webhook system operational for core entity changes
- [ ] Sync service can authenticate and perform CRUD operations in both systems
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms prevent data loss during sync failures
- [ ] Sync status tracking provides visibility into integration health

### Acceptance Criteria
- Authentication works for both Supabase service account and OpenProject API
- Webhooks trigger within 5 seconds of data changes in Supabase
- Failed sync operations are retried automatically with exponential backoff
- Sync status is tracked and visible in both systems
- Integration handles rate limiting from OpenProject API gracefully

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- OpenProject instance configured and accessible
- Supabase project with existing FLRTS schema (74 tables)
- Sync service development environment prepared

### External Dependencies
- OpenProject API availability and stability
- Supabase webhook reliability
- Network connectivity between systems

## Technical Overview

### Architecture Components
1. **Sync Service**: Node.js/TypeScript service managing bidirectional sync
2. **Authentication Layer**: Secure credential management for both systems
3. **Webhook Infrastructure**: Real-time change detection and propagation
4. **Error Handling System**: Retry logic, dead letter queues, and monitoring
5. **Sync Tracking**: Database tables tracking sync status and conflicts

### Data Flow
```
Supabase (SSOT) ←→ Sync Service ←→ OpenProject (Visualization)
                        ↓
                  Error Handling
                  Retry Queues
                  Status Tracking
```

### Key Technical Decisions
- Supabase remains the Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- OpenProject serves as visualization layer only
- Conflict resolution always favors Supabase data
- Webhook-driven real-time sync with batch reconciliation fallback

## User Stories

### Foundation Stories
1. **Authentication Setup**: Configure secure authentication for both systems
2. **Service Account Management**: Establish service accounts with appropriate permissions
3. **Connection Validation**: Implement health checks and connection testing
4. **Environment Configuration**: Set up development, staging, and production environments

### Webhook Infrastructure Stories
5. **Supabase Webhook Configuration**: Set up webhooks for core tables (tasks, users, sites)
6. **OpenProject Webhook Setup**: Configure OpenProject webhooks for work_packages
7. **Webhook Processing Service**: Build service to receive and process webhook events
8. **Webhook Security**: Implement webhook signature validation and authentication

### Error Handling & Monitoring Stories
9. **Retry Logic Implementation**: Build exponential backoff retry mechanisms
10. **Dead Letter Queue Setup**: Handle persistently failing sync operations
11. **Sync Status Tracking**: Create database tables to track sync operations
12. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Basic monitoring for sync service health
13. **Alert System**: Notifications for sync failures and service issues

### Data Integrity Stories
14. **Conflict Resolution Framework**: Implement SSOT-based conflict resolution
15. **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity during sync operations
16. **Rollback Capabilities**: Ability to rollback failed sync operations
17. **Sync Reconciliation**: Batch processes to identify and fix sync drift

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Current Issues to Address
1. **Authentication Bug**: Sync service cannot authenticate with Supabase using service key
2. **No Error Handling**: Current implementation lacks retry logic and error recovery
3. **Missing User Mapping**: No mechanism to map flrts_users to OpenProject users
4. **Priority Mapping Bug**: Supabase "High" incorrectly maps to OpenProject "Normal"

### Technical Debt Items
- Implement proper logging and observability
- Add unit and integration tests for sync operations
- Document API contracts and data schemas
- Set up proper CI/CD pipeline for sync service

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Authentication Complexity**: Multiple systems with different auth patterns
- **Webhook Reliability**: External systems may have unreliable webhook delivery
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenProject API rate limits may throttle sync operations

### Medium Risks
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring ACID properties across distributed systems
- **Service Availability**: Single sync service represents potential bottleneck

### Low Risks
- **Schema Changes**: Both systems have stable APIs
- **Performance**: Current data volumes are manageable

## Timeline Estimate

**Duration**: 3-4 sprints (6-8 weeks)

### Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1**: Authentication, basic connectivity, environment setup
- **Sprint 2**: Webhook infrastructure, basic sync operations  
- **Sprint 3**: Error handling, retry logic, monitoring
- **Sprint 4**: Testing, refinement, production deployment

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Sync service successfully authenticates with both Supabase and OpenProject
- [ ] Real-time webhooks operational for tasks table changes
- [ ] Error handling prevents data loss and provides meaningful error messages
- [ ] Sync status visible in monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Documentation complete for setup and troubleshooting
- [ ] Production deployment successful with monitoring in place

## Next Epic

Epic 2: Core Entity Sync will build upon this foundation to implement the actual synchronization of tasks, users, and sites between the systems.
