- **Near Real-time (< 4 hours)**: Invoice creation, cost entries
- **Daily Batch**: Financial reports, variance analysis
- **Weekly Reconciliation**: Complete financial data validation

### Data Volume Considerations
- **Invoice Volume**: Potentially hundreds of invoices per month
- **Time Entry Volume**: Daily time entries from field teams
- **Payment Transactions**: Multiple payments per invoice
- **Cost Allocation Complexity**: Single invoice may split across multiple projects

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar financial transactions
- **Incremental Updates**: Only sync changed financial data
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache calculated financial metrics
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize queries for financial reporting

## Technical Debt & Migration

### Migration Challenges
- **Historical Financial Data**: Years of historical invoices and payments
- **Chart of Accounts Mapping**: Existing GL accounts to OpenProject cost types
