# Story 3.6: Telegram Inline Keyboards

## Story

**As a** field operations user on mobile  
**I want** quick action buttons in bot responses  
**So that** I can tap instead of type during time-critical operations

## Context

Our team operates primarily on mobile during field work, incidents, and customer visits. Typing commands while walking, driving (passenger), or in meetings is inefficient. Inline keyboards provide instant actions via taps, critical for operational efficiency.

**UX Reference:** See `/docs/prd/Telegram-Bot-UX-Flows.md` for complete message templates, bot menu structure, and button layout specifications.
