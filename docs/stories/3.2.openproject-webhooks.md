# Story 2.1: Configure OpenProject Native Webhooks for Bidirectional Sync

**Priority:** HIGH
**Points:** 6
**Status:** Draft

## User Story

As a **project manager**, I want **OpenProject work package changes to automatically sync back to Supabase** so that **task updates made in OpenProject are reflected in the source system and available for Telegram notifications**.

## Business Value

- Enables true bidirectional sync between OpenProject and Supabase
- Maintains data consistency across all systems (Telegram, Supabase, OpenProject)
- Allows project managers to use OpenProject's advanced features while keeping Supabase as source of truth
- Provides foundation for conflict resolution and data integrity

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenProject webhooks configured for work package status changes, assignments, and due date updates
- [ ] n8n-cloud workflow receives OpenProject webhook events and updates Supabase
- [ ] Conflict resolution implemented with Supabase as source of truth
- [ ] Bidirectional sync loop prevention (avoid infinite webhook cycles)
- [ ] Webhook authentication and security properly configured

### Technical Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenProject webhook endpoints configured for relevant work package events
- [ ] n8n workflow processes OpenProject webhook payload format
- [ ] Supabase updates via `mcp__supabase__*` tools with proper field mapping

### 4. Supabase Update Integration

- [ ] Use `mcp__supabase__*` MCP tools for data updates
- [ ] Map OpenProject work package fields to Supabase tasks schema
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement atomic update operations

### 5. Loop Prevention and Monitoring

- [ ] Add sync origin tracking to prevent webhook loops
- [ ] Implement webhook delivery monitoring
- [ ] Create error alerting and dead letter handling
- [ ] Add sync performance and health monitoring

## Dev Notes

### MCP Tools to Use

- **`mcp__n8n-cloud__*`** - For workflow creation and webhook processing
- **`mcp__supabase__*`** - For database updates and conflict resolution
- **DO NOT** create custom sync services - use n8n workflows exclusively

### OpenProject Webhook Configuration

```json
{
  "url": "https://n8n-cloud-instance.com/webhook/openproject-sync",
  "events": [
    "work_package.updated.status",
    "work_package.updated.assigned_to", 
    "work_package.updated.due_date",
    "work_package.updated.priority"
  ],
  "authentication": {
    "type": "bearer_token",
    "token": "webhook-auth-token"
  }
}
```

### n8n Workflow Structure

```
[OpenProject Webhook] 
    ↓
[Payload Validation]
    ↓
[Conflict Detection] → [Skip if Loop]
    ↓
[Data Transformation]
    ↓
[Supabase Update] → [Error Handler]
    ↓
[Sync Status Logging]
```

### Field Mapping Configuration

```javascript
const FIELD_MAPPING = {
  // OpenProject → Supabase
  "status.name": "status",
  "assigned_to.id": "assignee_id", 
  "due_date": "due_date",
  "priority.name": "priority",
  "subject": "title",
  "description": "description",
  "updated_at": "openproject_updated_at"
};
```

### Conflict Resolution Logic

```javascript
// Conflict resolution strategy
if (supabase_updated_at > openproject_updated_at) {
  // Supabase is more recent, skip OpenProject update
  return { action: "skip", reason: "supabase_newer" };
} else {
  // Apply OpenProject changes to Supabase
  return { action: "update", source: "openproject" };
}
```

### Critical Implementation Notes

- **Use OpenProject's native webhook system** - no polling or custom triggers
- **Implement proper conflict resolution** - Supabase wins on conflicts
- **Add sync origin tracking** to prevent infinite webhook loops
- **Use atomic operations** for Supabase updates to prevent partial sync states

### Dependencies  

- OpenProject instance deployed and configured (Story 1.1)
- Supabase webhook workflow operational (Story 1.2)
- n8n-cloud instance with OpenProject and Supabase integrations
- Authentication tokens for both OpenProject and Supabase

### Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "action": "updated",
  "work_package": {
    "id": 123,
    "subject": "Fix HVAC unit at Building A",
    "status": { "id": 2, "name": "in_progress" },
    "assigned_to": { "id": 456, "name": "Sarah Johnson" },
    "due_date": "2024-01-15T17:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-10T14:30:00Z"
  },
  "user": { "id": 789, "name": "Project Manager" }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Webhook Delivery Testing

- [ ] Test work package status change in OpenProject triggers webhook
- [ ] Test assignee change triggers webhook with correct data
- [ ] Test due date modification triggers webhook  
- [ ] Test priority changes are captured and synced
- [ ] Verify webhook authentication working correctly

### Bidirectional Sync Testing

- [ ] Create task in Telegram → verify OpenProject creation → modify in OpenProject → verify Supabase sync
- [ ] Test concurrent updates (change same task in both systems simultaneously)
- [ ] Verify conflict resolution (Supabase wins) working correctly
- [ ] Test sync loop prevention (change in Supabase shouldn't trigger loop)

### Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Test webhook delivery when n8n-cloud is down
- [ ] Test sync with invalid/corrupted webhook payloads
- [ ] Test Supabase connection failures during sync
- [ ] Verify rollback on partial sync failures

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Webhook loops causing infinite sync cycles
  **Mitigation**: Implement sync origin tracking and loop detection

- **Risk**: Data corruption during conflict resolution
  **Mitigation**: Use atomic operations and proper transaction handling

### Business Risks

- **Risk**: Sync delays causing user confusion about task status
  **Mitigation**: Implement real-time monitoring and user feedback

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenProject webhooks reliably trigger on work package changes
- [ ] Bidirectional sync operational with conflict resolution
- [ ] No webhook loops or infinite sync cycles  
- [ ] Sync monitoring and error handling in place
- [ ] Data integrity maintained across all sync operations
- [ ] Ready for Story 2.2 reminder system integration

## QA Notes

- Test with realistic project manager workflows
- Verify sync works under concurrent user scenarios
- Check that sync doesn't impact OpenProject or Supabase performance
- Validate conflict resolution edge cases

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Webhook processing < 2 seconds
- [ ] Supabase updates < 1 second
- [ ] 99.9% sync success rate
- [ ] Conflict resolution < 500ms

### Test Coverage Assessment - Internal Tool (10 Users)

**STORY STATUS: CONCERNS - Additional Testing Required** ⚠️

Story has solid foundation but needs targeted test coverage for internal team reliability. Current testing is adequate for happy path but missing critical edge cases that could disrupt daily operations.

### Test Coverage Analysis ✅

**🟢 Adequate for Internal Use:**
- Basic webhook delivery testing sufficient for 10-user load
- Bidirectional sync happy path covers primary use cases
- Performance requirements realistic for team size (< 2 sec processing)

**🟡 Critical Gaps for Internal Reliability:**

1. **Conflict Resolution Edge Cases**
   - Same-second updates (realistic with active team)
   - System restart sync recovery procedures
   - Manual intervention workflows for stuck syncs

2. **Operational Resilience**
   - Monday morning recovery (weekend downtime scenarios)
   - Clear error visibility for non-technical team members
   - Troubleshooting procedures for common failures

3. **Basic Security (Trust but Verify)**
   - Webhook signature validation to prevent external interference
   - Input sanitization for OpenProject data integrity
   - Loop prevention to avoid weekend-disrupting infinite sync

### Required Test Additions

#### **Priority 1: Team Operations**
```yaml
Internal Team Test Suite:
  - Test sync recovery after system restart/reboot
  - Test conflict resolution with realistic 5-10 second timing gaps
  - Test manual retry procedures for failed webhooks
  - Verify sync status visibility for team debugging
  - Test "force-close OpenProject" recovery scenarios
```

#### **Priority 2: Error Visibility**
```yaml
Team-Focused Error Handling:
  - Clear error messages for common webhook failures
  - Sync status dashboard accessible to team
  - Weekend/holiday sync resumption validation
  - Manual rollback procedures documentation
```

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-openproject-webhooks.yml

**Quality Score: 70/100** - Solid foundation but needs internal team-focused test coverage

**Recommendation**: Add targeted test coverage for operational resilience before deployment to ensure smooth daily operations for the team.
