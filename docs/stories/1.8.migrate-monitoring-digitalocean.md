# Story 1.8: Migrate Monitoring Infrastructure to DigitalOcean Cloud

<!-- Source: Brownfield enhancement to existing docker-compose.monitoring.yml -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to migrate local-only monitoring to cloud deployment -->

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **system administrator** managing the FLRTS internal tool for 10 users, I
want **the monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, n8n-monitor)
migrated from local Docker deployment to DigitalOcean cloud deployment**, so
that **monitoring remains available even when local development machines are
offline, improving system reliability and enabling 24/7 observability**.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docker-compose.monitoring.yml and
  infrastructure/digitalocean/
- Enhancement Type: Infrastructure migration with reliability improvement
- Existing System Impact: No functionality change, improved availability and
  reliability

## Business Value

### Current Pain Points

- **Local-only monitoring**: Monitoring infrastructure only runs when developer
  machine is active
- **Single point of failure**: If local Docker goes down, all observability is
  lost
- **Limited access**: Only accessible from local development environment
- **No persistence**: Monitoring data lost when containers restart locally

### Expected Benefits

- **24/7 availability**: Monitoring infrastructure runs independently in cloud
- **Improved reliability**: DigitalOcean droplet provides better uptime than
  local development
- **Remote access**: Team can access monitoring dashboards from anywhere
- **Data persistence**: Monitoring data survives local development restarts
- **Cost-effective**: Estimated $40-60/month for dedicated monitoring
  infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

The monitoring infrastructure is currently defined in
`docker-compose.monitoring.yml` with the following services:

- **Prometheus v2.45.0**: Metrics collection on port 9090
- **Grafana v10.0.0**: Visualization on port 3000
- **Jaeger v1.49**: Distributed tracing on port 16686
- **n8n-monitor**: Custom webhook monitoring on port 3002
- **node-exporter v1.6.1**: System metrics on port 9100
- **cAdvisor v0.47.0**: Container metrics on port 8080

All services use a custom bridge network `flrts-monitoring` and have volumes for
data persistence.

### Integration Approach

**Follow the proven DigitalOcean deployment pattern** established in Story 1.1
(OpenProject deployment):

1. **Use existing DigitalOcean infrastructure** (`infrastructure/digitalocean/`)
2. **Replicate Cloudflare Tunnel pattern** for secure HTTPS access
3. **Apply similar firewall configuration** to block direct port access
4. **Use Docker Compose for service orchestration** (proven approach)

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: DigitalOcean Droplet Setup

- **Droplet Configuration**:
  - Size: `s-2vcpu-4gb` (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD) - sufficient for monitoring
    workload
  - Region: `nyc3` (matching existing OpenProject deployment)
  - OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - Estimated cost: $24/month

#### Phase 2: Docker Compose Adaptation

- **Base the cloud configuration on existing `docker-compose.monitoring.yml`**
- **Key changes needed**:
  - Update Prometheus scrape targets to use external IPs/hostnames
  - Configure volume mounts for cloud storage persistence
  - Add restart policies appropriate for cloud deployment
  - Configure logging for cloud environment

#### Phase 3: Cloudflare Integration

- **Create Cloudflare Tunnel** for secure access (following OpenProject pattern)
- **DNS configuration**:
  - `prometheus.monitoring.10nz.tools` → Prometheus UI
  - `grafana.monitoring.10nz.tools` → Grafana UI
  - `jaeger.monitoring.10nz.tools` → Jaeger UI
  - `n8n-monitor.monitoring.10nz.tools` → n8n Monitor API

#### Phase 4: Network Configuration

- **DigitalOcean Firewall Rules** (following proven pattern):
  - Allow: SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), ICMP
  - Block: All monitoring ports (9090, 3000, 16686, 3002, 9100, 8080)
  - Internal Docker network communication only

### Technical Constraints

1. **Network Access**: Cloud monitoring must reach local development services
   - **Solution**: Configure Prometheus to scrape external IPs/domains
   - **Alternative**: Use VPN or overlay network for secure connections

2. **Data Migration**: Existing Prometheus and Grafana data should be preserved
   - **Approach**: Export/import data during migration window
   - **Backup**: Create snapshots before migration

3. **Cost Management**: Keep monthly costs under $50
   - **Current estimate**: $24/month for droplet + minimal bandwidth costs
   - **Optimization**: Use appropriate droplet size, optimize data retention

4. **Service Dependencies**: Some monitoring targets are on local development
   machines
   - **Solution**: Update scrape configurations to use external endpoints
   - **Monitoring gap**: Consider adding health checks for connectivity

### Migration Strategy

#### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Export existing Grafana dashboards and datasources
- [ ] Backup Prometheus data (optional, can rebuild metrics)
- [ ] Document current scrape target configurations
- [ ] Test Cloudflare Tunnel setup in development

#### Migration Execution

1. **Parallel Deployment**: Set up cloud monitoring alongside local (no
   downtime)
2. **Gradual Cutover**: Update applications to send metrics to both local and
   cloud
3. **Validation Period**: Run both systems for 24-48 hours to ensure data
   consistency
4. **Final Cutover**: Switch applications to cloud-only monitoring
5. **Local Cleanup**: Shut down local monitoring infrastructure

#### Rollback Plan

- **Immediate rollback**: Restart local docker-compose.monitoring.yml
- **Data recovery**: Re-import backed up Grafana configurations
- **Service restoration**: Update applications back to local monitoring
  endpoints

### Missing Information

**Critical information needed from user:**

1. **Network Access Requirements**:
   - How should cloud monitoring reach local development services?
   - Are local services accessible via external IPs/domains?
   - Should we implement VPN connectivity?

2. **Authentication Preferences**:
   - Should Grafana use existing authentication system?
   - What level of access control is needed for monitoring?

3. **Data Retention Policy**:
   - Is 15-day retention sufficient for cloud deployment?
   - Should we implement automated backups to object storage?

4. **Budget Constraints**:
   - Is $40-60/month acceptable for monitoring infrastructure?
   - Any preference for reserved instances for cost savings?
