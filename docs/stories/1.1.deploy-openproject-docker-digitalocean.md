# Story 1.1: Deploy OpenProject via Docker Compose on Digital Ocean (Legacy)

Note: This story predates the Supabase single-database consolidation. Production
now uses a single Supabase PostgreSQL instance (no local Postgres container) per
ADR‑002. See infrastructure/digitalocean/docker-compose.supabase.yml for current
deployment.

## Story Overview

**Story ID**: 1.1 **Epic**: Epic 1 - OpenProject Integration Foundation
**Status**: In Progress - Migration Fix Applied **Points**: 8 **Priority**: P0
(Foundational)

### Critical Update (2025-01-15)

**Issue**: OpenProject container failing with 301 pending migrations error
**Root Cause**: The `openproject:14-slim` image does not auto-run migrations (by
design for production) **Solution**: Implemented migration init container
pattern (see ADR-001) **Status**: Migration strategy documented and ready for
implementation

## User Story

As a **distributed mining operations team**,  
I want **OpenProject Community Edition deployed on a reliable cloud VM with
secure access**,  
So that **our team can manage work packages and projects with 99.9% uptime and
sub-200ms response times**.

## Story Context

### Architecture Change Context

This story represents a complete architecture pivot from the original
(impossible) Cloudflare Workers deployment to a practical VM-based Docker
architecture. External consultants have confirmed that OpenProject (Ruby on
Rails) cannot run on Cloudflare Workers and requires traditional VM hosting.

### System Integration

- **Deployment Platform**: Digital Ocean Droplet (s-4vcpu-8gb, NYC3 region)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for service management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.8 (Supabase database with OpenProject schema)
- **Secure Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel (zero-trust, no open ports)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for file attachments via S3-compatible API
- **Technology**: OpenProject Community Edition 14.x

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **OpenProject Deployment**: OpenProject Community Edition 14.x successfully
   deployed via Docker Compose on Digital Ocean s-4vcpu-8gb droplet
2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL 15.8 (Supabase) properly configured
   with OpenProject schema in separate namespace
3. **Secure Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel configured for secure public access
   without exposing any ports directly on the VM
4. **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 bucket integrated via S3-compatible API for
   OpenProject file attachments
5. **Service Orchestration**: All services (OpenProject, Memcached, Cloudflare
   Tunnel) managed via docker-compose with proper health checks; database
   provided by Supabase
6. **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS access via Cloudflare with automatic certificate
   management
7. **Persistence**: Data persistence verified across container restarts and VM
   reboots

### Performance Requirements

8. **Response Time**: OpenProject web interface responds within 200ms for 95th
   percentile of requests
9. **Uptime**: Service demonstrates 99.9% availability over 24-hour test period
10. **Resource Usage**: VM resource utilization stays below 80% CPU and memory
    under normal load

### Security Requirements

11. **Zero-Trust Access**: No direct port exposure on Digital Ocean VM (only
    Cloudflare Tunnel outbound connections)
12. **Database Security**: PostgreSQL configured with secure passwords and
    restricted access
13. **API Security**: OpenProject API v3 endpoints accessible only through HTTPS
    with proper authentication

### Operational Requirements

14. **Monitoring**: Basic health checks configured for all containers with
    automatic restart on failure
15. **Backup Readiness**: Database configured for automated backup capability
    (implementation in later story)
16. **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide with all configuration files
    and environment variables documented

## Technical Implementation Details

### Digital Ocean VM Specification

- **Size**: s-4vcpu-8gb (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 160GB SSD)
- **Region**: NYC3 (optimal latency to Supabase us-east-2)
- **Cost**: $48/month (confirmed current pricing)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Docker Compose Architecture (Supabase)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  openproject-migrate:
    image: openproject/openproject:14-slim
    command: bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: ${SECRET_KEY_BASE}
      DATABASE_URL: ${SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL} # Supabase pooler, schema=openproject
  openproject:
    image: openproject/openproject:14-slim
    depends_on:
      openproject-migrate:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: ${SECRET_KEY_BASE}
      OPENPROJECT_DB__APPLICATION__MAIN__SCHEMA: openproject
      DATABASE_URL: ${SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL}
  memcached:
    image: memcached:alpine
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    command: tunnel run --token ${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
```

### Resource Allocation Strategy (no local DB)

| Service             | Memory     | CPU       | Storage   | Justification                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| OpenProject         | 4GB        | 2.0       | 40GB      | Primary application, handles web UI and API     |
| Memcached           | 384MB      | 0.25      | 1GB       | Rails cache for OpenProject                     |
| Cloudflare Tunnel   | 256MB      | 0.125     | 1GB       | Lightweight tunnel connector                    |
| System Overhead     | 1.75GB     | 0.875     | 99GB      | OS and Docker overhead                          |
| **Total (approx.)** | **~6.4GB** | **~3.25** | **160GB** | Matches VM specification; DB hosted by Supabase |

### Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

- **Tunnel Type**: Cloudflare Tunnel (not Workers)
- **Access Method**: Zero-trust via cloudflared Docker container
- **Domain**: openproject.{domain}.com (TLS managed by Cloudflare)
- **Ingress Rules**: Direct proxy to OpenProject container port 8080

### File Storage Integration

- **Provider**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
- **Integration**: OpenProject fog gem with S3 adapter
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for R2 credentials and bucket
- **Cost**: ~$2/month for estimated file storage

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks

- **VM Resource Exhaustion**: OpenProject + PostgreSQL may exceed 8GB under load
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor resource usage, optimize PostgreSQL configuration,
    upgrade to s-8vcpu-16gb if needed
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Reliability**: Tunnel connection failure could make system
  inaccessible
  - **Mitigation**: Configure tunnel with automatic reconnection, monitor tunnel
    health
- **R2 Integration Complexity**: S3 compatibility may have OpenProject-specific
  issues
  - **Mitigation**: Test file operations thoroughly, have local volume fallback
    ready

## QA Results

**QA Review Date**: 2025-09-16 **QA Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect) **Gate
Decision**: CONCERNS

### Test Coverage Assessment - Internal Tool (10 Users)

**STORY STATUS**: CONCERNS ⚠️

OpenProject deployment is functional but lacks comprehensive operational testing
for a 10-user internal tool. While basic functionality exists, critical gaps
remain in recovery procedures, monitoring, and error handling that could disrupt
daily team operations.

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Happy Path Testing - ADEQUATE**

- ✅ Basic deployment verified (OpenProject accessible via HTTPS)
- ✅ Login page functional
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificate working
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly (401 for unauthenticated)

**Edge Cases & Error Handling - GAPS**

- ❌ No testing for container failure recovery
- ❌ Missing VM resource exhaustion scenarios
- ❌ No Cloudflare Tunnel failure testing
- ❌ Database connection failure handling untested

**Integration Points - PARTIAL**

- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel integration verified
- ⚠️ PostgreSQL connection tested but limited scenarios
- ❌ R2 file storage integration not validated
- ❌ No cross-service failure testing

**Operational Resilience - CRITICAL GAPS**

- ❌ No container restart recovery testing
- ❌ VM reboot persistence not verified
- ❌ Manual intervention procedures undefined
- ❌ No monitoring/alerting for service failures

### Required Additions

**Priority 1 (Must Fix - Blocks Daily Operations)**:

- Container health monitoring and auto-restart validation
- Database persistence across VM reboots
- Clear error messages for common failures (DB down, tunnel disconnected)
- Manual recovery procedures documentation

**Priority 2 (Should Fix - Operational Improvement)**:

- Performance validation (< 200ms response time requirement)
- Resource utilization monitoring under normal load
- R2 file storage integration testing
- Backup/restore procedure validation

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have - Future Enhancement)**:

- Load testing beyond 10 concurrent users
- Complex failure scenario testing
- Advanced monitoring dashboard
