# Story 1.1: Deploy OpenProject via Docker Compose on Digital Ocean

## Story Overview

**Story ID**: 1.1  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - OpenProject Integration Foundation  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Points**: 8  
**Priority**: P0 (Foundational)  

## User Story

As a **distributed mining operations team**,  
I want **OpenProject Community Edition deployed on a reliable cloud VM with secure access**,  
So that **our team can manage work packages and projects with 99.9% uptime and sub-200ms response times**.

## Story Context

### Architecture Change Context

This story represents a complete architecture pivot from the original (impossible) Cloudflare Workers deployment to a practical VM-based Docker architecture. External consultants have confirmed that OpenProject (Ruby on Rails) cannot run on Cloudflare Workers and requires traditional VM hosting.

### System Integration

- **Deployment Platform**: Digital Ocean Droplet (s-4vcpu-8gb, NYC3 region)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for service management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (dedicated container for OpenProject - required for compatibility)
- **Secure Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel (zero-trust, no open ports)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for file attachments via S3-compatible API
- **Technology**: OpenProject Community Edition 14.x

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **OpenProject Deployment**: OpenProject Community Edition 14.x successfully deployed via Docker Compose on Digital Ocean s-4vcpu-8gb droplet
2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL 16 database container properly configured with persistent storage and OpenProject schema initialization
3. **Secure Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel configured for secure public access without exposing any ports directly on the VM
4. **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 bucket integrated via S3-compatible API for OpenProject file attachments
5. **Service Orchestration**: All services (OpenProject, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare Tunnel) managed via docker-compose.yml with proper health checks
6. **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS access via Cloudflare with automatic certificate management
7. **Persistence**: Data persistence verified across container restarts and VM reboots

### Performance Requirements

8. **Response Time**: OpenProject web interface responds within 200ms for 95th percentile of requests
9. **Uptime**: Service demonstrates 99.9% availability over 24-hour test period
10. **Resource Usage**: VM resource utilization stays below 80% CPU and memory under normal load

### Security Requirements

11. **Zero-Trust Access**: No direct port exposure on Digital Ocean VM (only Cloudflare Tunnel outbound connections)
12. **Database Security**: PostgreSQL configured with secure passwords and restricted access
13. **API Security**: OpenProject API v3 endpoints accessible only through HTTPS with proper authentication

### Operational Requirements

14. **Monitoring**: Basic health checks configured for all containers with automatic restart on failure
15. **Backup Readiness**: Database configured for automated backup capability (implementation in later story)
16. **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide with all configuration files and environment variables documented

## Technical Implementation Details

### Digital Ocean VM Specification

- **Size**: s-4vcpu-8gb (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 160GB SSD)
- **Region**: NYC3 (optimal latency to Supabase us-east-2)
- **Cost**: $48/month (confirmed current pricing)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Docker Compose Architecture

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml structure (detailed configuration in implementation)
version: '3.8'
services:
  openproject:
    image: openproject/community:14
    # Resource allocation: 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU
  openproject-db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    # Resource allocation: 2GB RAM, 1 vCPU
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    # Cloudflare Tunnel connector
volumes:
  openproject-data:
  openproject-db-data:
```

### Resource Allocation Strategy

| Service | Memory | CPU | Storage | Justification |
|---------|--------|-----|---------|---------------|
| OpenProject | 4GB | 2.0 | 40GB | Primary application, handles web UI and API |
| PostgreSQL | 2GB | 1.0 | 20GB | Database with moderate concurrent users |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | 256MB | 0.125 | 1GB | Lightweight tunnel connector |
| System Overhead | 1.75GB | 0.875 | 99GB | OS and Docker overhead |
| **Total** | **8GB** | **4.0** | **160GB** | Matches VM specification exactly |

### Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

- **Tunnel Type**: Cloudflare Tunnel (not Workers)
- **Access Method**: Zero-trust via cloudflared Docker container
- **Domain**: openproject.{domain}.com (TLS managed by Cloudflare)
- **Ingress Rules**: Direct proxy to OpenProject container port 8080

### File Storage Integration

- **Provider**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
- **Integration**: OpenProject fog gem with S3 adapter
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for R2 credentials and bucket
- **Cost**: ~$2/month for estimated file storage

## Definition of Done
