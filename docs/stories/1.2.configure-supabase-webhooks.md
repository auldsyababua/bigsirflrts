# Story 1.2: Configure Supabase Native Webhooks to Trigger n8n-cloud

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Points:** 3
**Status:** Active

## User Story
As a **system integrator**, I want **Supabase native webhooks configured to trigger n8n-cloud workflows** so that **task changes in Supabase automatically sync to OpenProject without polling delays**.

## Business Value
- Eliminates polling delays - changes sync instantly via webhooks
- Reduces system load by using event-driven architecture
- Provides reliable integration foundation for bidirectional sync
- Leverages n8n-cloud's managed infrastructure for workflow automation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supabase webhook configured for tasks table INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- [ ] Webhook successfully triggers n8n-cloud workflow on every tasks table change
- [ ] n8n-cloud workflow receives complete row data including before/after states
- [ ] Webhook delivery confirmed with proper HTTP response codes (200/201)
- [ ] Error handling implemented for failed webhook deliveries

### Technical Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Webhook endpoint URL configured in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] HTTP headers properly configured for n8n authentication
- [ ] Webhook payload format validated and documented  
- [ ] n8n workflow properly receives and processes webhook data
- [ ] Retry logic configured for transient failures

### Monitoring Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Webhook delivery logs visible in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] n8n workflow execution logs show successful webhook processing
- [ ] Failed deliveries logged and alerting configured
- [ ] Response time monitoring for webhook → workflow latency

## Tasks and Subtasks

### 1. Supabase Webhook Configuration
- [ ] Access Supabase project dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Database → Webhooks configuration
- [ ] Create new webhook for `tasks` table
- [ ] Configure trigger events: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- [ ] Set webhook endpoint URL (n8n-cloud webhook URL)

### 2. n8n-cloud Workflow Setup
- [ ] Log into n8n-cloud instance using MCP tools
- [ ] Create new workflow with Webhook trigger node
- [ ] Configure webhook node to receive Supabase payloads
- [ ] Set up proper authentication/security for webhook endpoint
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint responds with proper HTTP codes

### 3. Webhook Payload Configuration
- [ ] Configure Supabase to send full row data in payload
- [ ] Include both OLD and NEW row data for UPDATE events
- [ ] Add table name and operation type to payload
- [ ] Configure proper Content-Type headers (application/json)

### 4. Authentication and Security
- [ ] Set up webhook authentication using HTTP headers
- [ ] Configure n8n webhook to validate incoming requests
- [ ] Add IP whitelist if required by Supabase
- [ ] Store authentication tokens securely

### 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create test task in Supabase to trigger webhook
- [ ] Update test task to verify UPDATE webhook
- [ ] Delete test task to verify DELETE webhook
- [ ] Verify n8n workflow receives and logs all events correctly

## Dev Notes

### MCP Tools to Use
- **`mcp__supabase__*`** tools for Supabase configuration and testing
- **`mcp__n8n-cloud__*`** tools for workflow creation and management
- **DO NOT** create custom webhook handlers - use n8n's built-in Webhook node

### Supabase Webhook Configuration
```sql
-- Enable webhooks on tasks table
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_tasks_webhook()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Webhook will be triggered automatically by Supabase
  -- No custom trigger function needed for native webhooks
  RETURN COALESCE(NEW, OLD);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### n8n Workflow Structure
```
[Webhook Trigger] → [Data Processing] → [Error Handling] → [Success Response]
```

### Webhook Payload Example
```json
{
  "type": "INSERT",
  "table": "tasks", 
  "record": {
    "id": "123",
    "title": "Sample Task",
    "assignee_id": "user-456",
    "status": "open",
    "due_date": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "old_record": null
}
```

### Critical Implementation Notes
- **Use Supabase native webhooks**, not pg_notify or custom triggers
- **Configure webhook at table level**, not database level
- **Use n8n-cloud's managed infrastructure** - no custom hosting
- **Test thoroughly with all CRUD operations** before proceeding

### n8n-cloud Workflow Configuration
```javascript
// Webhook node configuration
{
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "path": "supabase-tasks-webhook",
  "responseMode": "responseNode",
  "authentication": "headerAuth"
}
```

### Dependencies
- Supabase project with tasks table already created
- n8n-cloud instance accessible via MCP tools
- Webhook endpoint URL from n8n-cloud
- Authentication tokens configured

## Testing Requirements

### Webhook Delivery Testing
- [ ] Test INSERT: Create new task in Supabase
- [ ] Test UPDATE: Modify existing task in Supabase  
- [ ] Test DELETE: Remove task from Supabase
- [ ] Verify each operation triggers webhook within 1 second
- [ ] Check webhook payload contains expected data structure

### n8n Workflow Testing
- [ ] Verify workflow executes on webhook receipt
- [ ] Check workflow receives complete payload data
- [ ] Test error handling for malformed payloads
- [ ] Validate workflow responds with proper HTTP status

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Test webhook delivery when n8n-cloud is temporarily down
- [ ] Verify retry behavior for failed deliveries
- [ ] Test webhook with invalid authentication
- [ ] Check error logging and alerting

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Supabase webhook delivery failures due to network issues
  **Mitigation**: Configure retry logic and dead letter queue in Supabase

- **Risk**: n8n-cloud rate limiting or downtime
  **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff, monitor n8n-cloud status

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Webhook misconfiguration causing data sync issues
  **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with all CRUD operations before production

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Supabase webhook reliably triggers n8n workflow on tasks table changes
- [ ] All webhook events (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) properly processed
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic operational
- [ ] Webhook delivery monitoring and logging in place
- [ ] Documentation updated with webhook configuration
- [ ] Ready for Story 1.3 Telegram task creation workflow

## QA Notes
- Monitor webhook delivery logs during testing
- Verify webhook payloads contain all required data fields
- Test webhook resilience with rapid successive changes
- Check that webhook doesn't impact Supabase performance

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Webhook delivery latency < 1 second
- [ ] n8n workflow execution time < 3 seconds
- [ ] 99% webhook delivery success rate
