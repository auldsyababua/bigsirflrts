# Story 1.2.5: PostgreSQL Version Validation

## Story

**As a** system administrator
**I want to** ensure the Supabase database meets version requirements
**So that** OpenProject runs without compatibility issues and maintains data integrity

## Context

Architecture review confirmed FLRTS Supabase project is running PostgreSQL 15.8.1, which is the supported version for both OpenProject and Supabase. This story validates compatibility and documents the configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Required

1. **Version Validation**
   - [ ] Execute `SELECT version()` on existing FLRTS database
   - [ ] Confirm version is 15.8.x (Supabase default)
   - [ ] Verify OpenProject compatibility with 15.8

2. **Configuration Documentation**
   - [ ] Document PostgreSQL 15.8 as the standard version
   - [ ] Note that pgjwt extension requires 15.8 (breaks in v17)
   - [ ] Update all documentation to reflect 15.8 requirement
   - [ ] Remove any references to PostgreSQL 16+

3. **Validation**
   - [ ] Verify current version: `SELECT version()` returns 15.8.x
   - [ ] Test OpenProject container can connect
   - [ ] Confirm Session Mode works on port 5432
   - [ ] Document decision rationale in `/docs/architecture/decisions/`

### Testing

- [ ] OpenProject health check passes
- [ ] No PostgreSQL compatibility warnings in logs
- [ ] Session pooling maintains connection stability

## Technical Notes

- **Confirmed**: PostgreSQL 15.8 is fully compatible with OpenProject
- **Important**: pgjwt extension requires 15.8 (not compatible with v17)
- **Standard**: Use Supabase default version for best compatibility

## Dependencies

- Blocks: Story 1.3 (Supabase setup)
- Blocks: Story 1.4 (OpenProject deployment)

## Effort

- **Points**: 3
- **Risk**: Low (using standard Supabase version)
- **Priority**: P0 - BLOCKER

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PostgreSQL version 15.8.x confirmed
- [ ] Decision documented with justification
- [ ] All team members notified of connection string changes (if new project)
- [ ] Architecture diagram updated with correct version
