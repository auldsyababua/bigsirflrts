# Story 1.1: Deploy OpenProject to Cloudflare

**Priority:** HIGH
**Points:** 5
**Status:** Draft

## User Story
As a **project manager**, I want **OpenProject deployed on Cloudflare Workers** so that **I can access a reliable, cloud-hosted project management system that integrates with our task automation workflows**.

## Business Value
- Provides production-ready OpenProject instance for task/project visualization
- Leverages Cloudflare's global edge network for fast response times
- Enables webhook integration for bidirectional sync with Supabase
- Foundation for entire MVP architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenProject deployed successfully to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler
- [ ] OpenProject accessible via custom Cloudflare domain with HTTPS
- [ ] Basic project structure configured (at minimum: "Tasks" project)
- [ ] API authentication working with proper API keys
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding successfully
- [ ] Admin user account created and accessible

### Technical Acceptance Criteria  
- [ ] Wrangler configuration file (`wrangler.toml`) properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables set for database connection and API keys
- [ ] OpenProject database initialized with required tables
- [ ] CORS configured for API access from n8n workflows
- [ ] Basic monitoring/logging enabled for debugging

### Security Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API keys stored securely in Cloudflare Workers environment
- [ ] Database connection encrypted and properly configured
- [ ] Admin access secured with strong authentication
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in deployment logs

## Tasks and Subtasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Wrangler CLI
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Workers account with proper permissions
- [ ] Configure domain and DNS settings for OpenProject instance
- [ ] Source MCP environment: `source ~/.config/mcp/.env`

### 2. OpenProject Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Set up Cloudflare D1 database for OpenProject data
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets

### 3. Database Initialization
- [ ] Run OpenProject database migrations
- [ ] Create initial admin user account
- [ ] Set up basic project structure (Tasks project)
- [ ] Configure default work package types (Task, Bug, Feature)

### 4. API and Integration Setup
- [ ] Configure API authentication tokens
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
- [ ] Enable webhook capabilities in OpenProject
- [ ] Set up CORS for n8n workflow access

### 5. Verification and Testing
- [ ] Verify OpenProject web interface accessibility
- [ ] Test basic work package creation/editing
- [ ] Validate API responses and authentication
- [ ] Perform health check and monitoring setup

## Dev Notes

### MCP Tools to Use
- Use **Cloudflare Wrangler** for deployment and configuration
- **DO NOT** build custom deployment scripts - use Wrangler's native commands
- Reference OpenProject's official Docker/cloud deployment docs

### Key Configuration Points
- **Database**: Use Cloudflare D1 for persistence
- **Storage**: Configure Cloudflare R2 for file uploads if needed
- **Environment**: Production-ready config from day one
- **API Keys**: Store in Cloudflare Workers secrets, not environment variables

### OpenProject Configuration
```toml
# wrangler.toml example structure
name = "openproject-flrts"
main = "src/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "OPENPROJECT_DB"
database_name = "openproject-production"
database_id = "your-database-id"
```

### Critical Implementation Notes
- **Use OpenProject's official Cloudflare Workers adapter** if available
- **Configure for production from start** - no dev/staging shortcuts
- **Set up proper logging** for webhook debugging later
- **Test API endpoints thoroughly** before marking complete

### Dependencies
- Cloudflare Workers account with D1 database enabled
- Domain configured in Cloudflare DNS
- OpenProject source code or Docker image compatible with Workers
- Admin email/password for initial setup

### API Endpoints to Verify
- `/api/v3/work_packages` - Work package CRUD
- `/api/v3/projects` - Project management  
- `/api/v3/users` - User management
- `/webhooks/*` - Webhook configuration endpoints

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Can access OpenProject web interface at deployed URL
- [ ] Can log in with admin credentials  
- [ ] Can create and edit a basic work package
- [ ] Can access API endpoints with proper authentication
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK status

### API Testing
- [ ] Test work package creation via API
- [ ] Test work package updates via API
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint availability
- [ ] Test authentication with API keys

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] API responses < 1 second
- [ ] Health check < 500ms

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: OpenProject may not be fully compatible with Cloudflare Workers
  **Mitigation**: Test compatibility early, have backup plan for standard cloud hosting

- **Risk**: Database migration complexity
  **Mitigation**: Use OpenProject's built-in migration tools, test on staging first

### Business Risks  
- **Risk**: Extended deployment time affecting Sprint 1 timeline
  **Mitigation**: Timebox to 2 days max, escalate if blocked

## Definition of Done
- [ ] OpenProject accessible and functional at production URL
- [ ] API authentication working with all required endpoints
- [ ] Basic project structure created and usable
- [ ] Health monitoring operational
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment details
- [ ] Ready for webhook integration in Story 1.2

## QA Notes
- Test in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility
- Verify API rate limiting is properly configured
- Check that all required OpenProject modules are enabled
- Validate security headers and HTTPS configuration

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story is in Draft status with no implementation yet. Review focuses on requirements completeness, test planning, and risk assessment. This is a high-risk foundational story that requires careful attention to deployment strategy and testing approach.

### Refactoring Performed

N/A - Story not yet implemented

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (no code yet)
- Project Structure: ✓ Story structure follows BMAD v4
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing comprehensive test scenarios
- All ACs Met: N/A (not implemented)

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Items (Block deployment):**
- [ ] Define fallback strategy if Cloudflare Workers incompatible
- [ ] Create Given-When-Then test scenarios for all ACs
- [ ] Add rate limiting configuration to prevent abuse
- [ ] Define monitoring and alerting strategy
- [ ] Create rollback procedure documentation
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms

**Important Items (Should address):**
- [ ] Create integration test suite for API endpoints
- [ ] Add security test scenarios (pen testing, auth bypass attempts)
- [ ] Define load testing requirements and targets
- [ ] Document troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Add debug endpoints for production diagnostics

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Consider blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Create runbook for operational tasks

### Security Review

**Critical Findings:**
- Missing rate limiting specification (DoS vulnerability)
- No input validation requirements defined
- Security headers not specified (XSS, clickjacking risks)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting at Cloudflare edge
- Define OWASP-compliant input validation rules
- Configure security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Performance Considerations

Basic performance targets defined but missing:
- Concurrent user capacity
- Database connection pooling strategy
- CDN caching configuration
- Query optimization requirements

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**
1. **Deployment Platform** (Risk Score: 8/10)
   - OpenProject on Cloudflare Workers is experimental
   - No proven deployment patterns available
   - Mitigation: Have AWS/GCP backup plan ready

2. **Data Persistence** (Risk Score: 7/10)
   - Cloudflare D1 is relatively new for production workloads
   - Limited migration tools available
   - Mitigation: Daily backups, data export capability

3. **Integration Complexity** (Risk Score: 6/10)
   - Multiple moving parts (Workers, D1, R2, API)
   - Webhook reliability concerns
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration testing
