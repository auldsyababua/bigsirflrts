# Missing Documentation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-01 **Related:**
[LINEAR-DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md](LINEAR-DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md) **Purpose:** Track
documentation referenced in Linear issues but not yet created

## Executive Summary

**Missing Documentation:** 15 files expected but not created **Phase 1 Impact:**
4 documents (High Priority) **Phase 2+ Impact:** 11 documents (Medium/Future
Priority) **Recommended Action:** Create placeholder files or track creation in
Linear stories

---

## Definition

**Missing Documentation** = Documentation files that are:

- Referenced in Linear issue descriptions or comments
- Listed in template files as expected outputs
- Mentioned in workflow documents as deliverables
- **But do not exist in the repository yet**

**Why This Matters:**

- Broken links in Linear issues
- Unclear what needs to be created
- Difficulty tracking documentation deliverables
- Risk of forgetting critical documentation

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (This Week)

**Create placeholder files for critical Phase 1 documents:**

```bash
# Create empty placeholder files with headers
touch docs/research/erpnext-fsm-module-analysis.md
# Note: docs/prompts/ is local-only (not tracked in Git)
touch docs/migration/schema-mapping.md
touch docs/migration/data-migration-strategy.md
```

**Add to each placeholder:**

```markdown
# [Document Title]

**Status:** Not Started **Phase:** [Phase number] **Agent:** [Preferred agent]
**Date Created:** 2025-10-01 **Related Linear:** [Issue ID]

## Purpose

[What this document should contain]

## Prerequisites

- [ ] [What needs to be completed first]

## Template

[Suggested structure]
```

### Phase 2 (Next 2 Weeks)

**During Phase 1 execution:**

- As each Phase 1 story (10N-228 to 10N-232) progresses, fill in the
  corresponding placeholder documents
- Update Linear stories when documents are completed

### Phase 3 (Ongoing)

**Create Medium priority documents just-in-time:**

- Don't create Phase 2+ documents until they're actually needed
- Add to Linear stories as deliverables when implementation begins

---

## Tracking Approach

### Option 1: Create Placeholder Files (Recommended)

**Pros:**

- Shows clear intent
- Prevents broken links
- Can track via git
- Easy to find missing content

**Cons:**

- Empty files clutter repository
- Might create confusion

### Option 2: Track in Linear Only

**Pros:**

- No empty files
- Clear ownership via Linear stories

**Cons:**

- Harder to discover missing docs
- Links break until created

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 for Phase 1 critical docs (4 files), Option 2
for future docs.

---

## Linear Story Suggestions

### Create Story: "Phase 1 Documentation Completion"

```markdown
**Title:** Phase 1 Documentation Completion Tracking **Team:** BigSirFLRTS
**Parent:** 10N-227 (ERPNext Backend Adoption) **Labels:** documentation,
phase-1

**Description:** Track completion of all Phase 1 required documentation.

**Critical Documents:**

- [ ] docs/research/erpnext-fsm-module-analysis.md (10N-230)
- [ ] docs/prompts/module-migration-prompt.md (10N-231)
- [ ] docs/migration/schema-mapping.md (10N-232)
- [ ] docs/migration/data-migration-strategy.md (10N-232)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All 4 documents exist and are complete
- All documents linked from respective Linear stories
- All documents follow naming standards
```

---

## Prevention Strategy

**To avoid missing documentation in future:**

1. **Linear Story Template:** Add "Documentation Deliverables" section to all
   story templates
2. **Definition of Done:** Include "Required documentation created and linked"
   in DoD
3. **Code Review:** Check for documentation references in PR descriptions
4. **Weekly Review:** Review LINEAR-DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md weekly for gaps
