**DEPRECATED**: This document describes monitoring for Supabase → n8n webhook
integration from the Supabase era (pre-ADR-006, September 2025). Following the
Frappe Cloud migration, the project now uses AWS Lambda → ERPNext direct
integration. This document is retained for historical reference only.

**Current Monitoring Guide:** See `docs/monitoring/telegram-bot-monitoring.md`
for the current Lambda → ERPNext monitoring setup.
