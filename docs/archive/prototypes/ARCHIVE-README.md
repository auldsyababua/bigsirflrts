Linear integration module for BigSirFLRTS. Exports LinearIntegration class
with methods for getCurrentUser(), getProject(), etc.

### Why Archived

- No imports found in entire codebase
- Single-file directory (anti-pattern)
- Last meaningful change was linting, not feature work
- Likely superseded by @linear/sdk direct usage
