## Compliance Statement

This test execution was performed in accordance with Story 1.1 QA Gate requirements.
All tests were executed with full evidence collection as mandated.
No shortcuts or simulations were used - all tests represent real failure scenarios and recovery.

## Next Steps

$(if [ $TESTS_FAILED -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "1. Review all evidence files for completeness"
    echo "2. Submit evidence package to QA team"
    echo "3. Proceed with Story 1.2 upon QA approval"
else

    echo "2. Implement necessary fixes"
    echo "3. Re-run failed tests"
    echo "4. Submit updated evidence to QA team"
