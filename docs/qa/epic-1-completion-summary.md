  - ✅ All monitoring views functional: active_connections, database_metrics,
    performance_summary, slow_queries, table_stats
  - ✅ Performance summary shows healthy metrics (99.98% cache hit ratio, 17
    active connections)
  - ✅ Test coverage: P0 test suite implemented and passing

### ✅ Story 1.8: Monitoring Infrastructure Migration - PASS

- **Gate Status**: PASS
- **Architecture**: Successfully migrated to DigitalOcean cloud deployment
- **Validation**: Monitoring infrastructure accessible at
  \*.monitoring.10nz.tools
- **Cost Optimization**: Single-droplet integration ($0 additional cost vs
