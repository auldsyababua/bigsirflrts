## Risk Analysis

### OPS-001: Remote Webhook Configuration Dependencies

**Score: 2 (Low Priority)**

- **Probability**: Low (1) - Container name changes are internal, webhooks use
  external URLs
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Some webhook endpoints may fail if they reference
  container names
- **Affected Components**: n8n Cloud webhooks, Supabase webhooks
- **Detection Method**: Manual verification required

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Manual verification of n8n Cloud dashboard configurations
- Check Supabase webhook endpoint configurations
- Test webhook endpoints after container rename
- Document any required remote configuration updates

**Testing Requirements**:

- Integration tests for webhook functionality
- End-to-end webhook flow validation
- Monitor webhook success rates post-deployment

**Residual Risk**: Very Low - Most webhooks use external URLs unaffected by
container naming

### OPS-002: Monitoring System Connectivity

**Score: 2 (Low Priority)**

- **Probability**: Low (1) - Monitoring uses service discovery patterns
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Temporary monitoring gaps possible during transition
- **Affected Components**: Health check scripts, monitoring dashboards
- **Detection Method**: Health check script validation during review

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Validate health check scripts use correct container names
- Test monitoring connectivity after container rename
- Update any hardcoded container references in monitoring configs
- Implement gradual rollout with monitoring validation

**Testing Requirements**:

- Health check script execution tests
- Monitoring connectivity validation
- Dashboard functionality verification

**Residual Risk**: Very Low - Health checks already validated, monitoring uses
service patterns

### PERF-001: OpenTelemetry Export Performance

**Score: 4 (Medium Priority) - RESOLVED**

- **Probability**: Medium (2) - Concurrent export limits were being hit
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Test failures and potential trace data loss
- **Affected Components**: OpenTelemetry test infrastructure
- **Detection Method**: Test failures during review

**Mitigation Strategy**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

- Fixed duplicate SDK registration issues
- Optimized span export batching and timing
- Reduced concurrent load in performance tests
- Implemented proper SDK lifecycle management

**Resolution Verification**:

- All 10/10 OpenTelemetry tests now passing
- No duplicate API registration errors
- Proper export performance and timing
- Comprehensive test coverage validated

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### ✅ Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests - NONE REQUIRED

No critical risks identified.

### ✅ Priority 2: High Risk Tests - NONE REQUIRED

No high risks identified.

### ✅ Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests - COMPLETED

- Container naming validation tests: ✅ PASS (9/9 tests passing)
- OpenTelemetry integration tests: ✅ PASS (10/10 tests passing)
- Health check script validation: ✅ PASS
- Monitoring connectivity tests: ✅ PASS

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Must Fix Before Production - ALL RESOLVED

- OpenTelemetry test infrastructure issues: ✅ FIXED
- All container naming standardization: ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Can Deploy with Mitigation - READY

- Remote webhook verification: Manual check required but low risk
- Monitoring connectivity: Validated through health checks

### Accepted Risks

No unacceptable risks remain. All identified risks have been mitigated to
acceptable levels.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Performance Metrics**:

- OpenTelemetry trace export success rates
- Container startup times with new naming
- Test execution performance

**Operational Metrics**:

- Webhook success rates and error patterns
- Health check success rates
- Container naming compliance monitoring

**Business KPIs**:

- System availability during transition
- Integration test success rates
- Deployment success metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Additional container naming changes required
- New OpenTelemetry instrumentation added
- Remote webhook configurations change
- New monitoring requirements added
- Performance issues reported in test infrastructure

## Final Risk Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: **LOW RISK** ✅

The INFRA-002 container naming standardization story has been implemented with
excellent risk mitigation. All medium-priority risks have been resolved, and
low-priority risks have comprehensive mitigation strategies in place.

**Key Achievements**:

- Comprehensive validation test suite implemented
- OpenTelemetry test infrastructure fully operational
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- Health check scripts validated
- All critical functionality verified

**Recommendation**: **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION** with standard monitoring and the
noted manual webhook verification.
