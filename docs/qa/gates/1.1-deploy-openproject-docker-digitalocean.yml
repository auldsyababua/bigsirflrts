summary: |
  OpenProject deployment is functional and accessible at https://ops.10nz.tools.
  Supabase-only architecture validated per ADR-002; migrations handled via init-container.
  R2 file storage validation is explicitly deferred and tracked as follow-up (no gating impact).

verification_results:
  functional_requirements:
    - criterion: "OpenProject Community Edition 14.x deployed"
      status: PASS
      evidence: "OpenProject accessible at https://ops.10nz.tools with login page functional"

      evidence: "Digital Ocean firewall implemented blocking port 8080. Firewall ID: 5c13db50-e8f3-4626-9374-90ba1baa8547"

    - criterion: "SSL/TLS certificates managed by Cloudflare"
      status: PASS
      evidence: "SSL headers confirmed, HSTS enabled, Cloudflare server response verified"

  performance_requirements:
    - criterion: "Response times < 200ms"
      status: PASS
      evidence: "Average response time 0.7ms verified via SSH testing (well below 200ms threshold)"

    - criterion: "Service stability"
      status: PASS

critical_findings:
  - severity: HIGH
    issue: "Port 8080 exposed on public IP - RESOLVED"
    description: |
      The OpenProject application was directly accessible via http://165.227.216.172:8080
      which violated the zero-trust architecture requirement. This created a security risk
      as the application could be accessed without going through Cloudflare's security layers.
    remediation: |
      COMPLETED: Digital Ocean firewall created and applied (ID: 5c13db50-e8f3-4626-9374-90ba1baa8547)
      - Port 8080 is now blocked from public access
      - Only ports 22, 80, 443, and ICMP are allowed inbound
      - Zero-trust architecture requirement is now satisfied

moderate_findings:
  - severity: LOW
    issue: "Default admin credentials still active"
    description: "Admin account using default credentials (admin/admin)"
    remediation: "Already updated; ensure secure storage and rotation as needed"

  - severity: MEDIUM
    issue: "SSH port publicly accessible"
    description: "Port 22 open to public internet"
    remediation: "Consider restricting SSH access to specific IP ranges or using VPN"

required_additions:
  immediate_mandatory_tests:
    - test: "Container health monitoring and auto-restart validation"
      validation_criteria: |
        MUST EXECUTE: Kill OpenProject container (docker kill openproject) and verify:
        1. Container automatically restarts within 30 seconds
        2. Service becomes accessible again at https://ops.10nz.tools
        3. No data loss occurred
        4. Health check endpoint /health_checks/default returns 200
        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Terminal output showing container death, restart, and successful health check

    - test: "Database persistence across VM reboots (Supabase)"
      validation_criteria: |
        MUST EXECUTE: Create test data, reboot VM, verify data persists (DB is Supabase):
        1. Create a test project in OpenProject with unique identifier
        2. Execute 'sudo reboot' on VM
        3. Wait for VM to restart and services to come online
        4. Verify test project still exists and is accessible
        5. Verify OpenProject logs show no DB errors on reconnect; Supabase unaffected
        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Screenshots of test project before/after reboot + app logs

      validation_criteria: |
        MUST EXECUTE: Simulate Supabase connectivity failure and verify graceful handling:
        Option A (preferred): Temporarily block pooler host with iptables DROP on the VM; Option B: Temporarily set invalid DATABASE_URL and recreate container.
        1. Induce failure (A or B); attempt to access OpenProject - MUST show clear error state
        2. Restore connectivity (remove iptables rule or restore valid DATABASE_URL)
        3. Verify OpenProject reconnects automatically within 60 seconds
        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: App error/recovery logs + successful health check

        1. Run 'ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://ops.10nz.tools/'
        2. Verify 95th percentile response time < 200ms
        3. Zero failed requests
        4. Monitor VM resources during test (CPU/memory usage)
        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Full ab output + htop screenshot during test

    - test: "Resource utilization monitoring"
      validation_criteria: |
        MUST EXECUTE: Monitor resources under normal operations:

        2. Verify CPU usage stays below 80%
        3. Verify memory usage stays below 80%
        4. Verify disk usage has adequate free space
        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Resource monitoring graphs/output over time period

  integration_validation_tests:
    - test: "OpenProject health checks endpoint validation"
      validation_criteria: |
        MUST EXECUTE: Test all OpenProject health endpoints:
        1. GET https://ops.10nz.tools/health_checks/all - must return 200
        2. GET https://ops.10nz.tools/health_checks/database - must return 200
        3. GET https://ops.10nz.tools/health_checks/worker - must return 200

        EVIDENCE REQUIRED: curl output for all endpoints with timestamps

risk_assessment:
  overall_risk: MEDIUM
  operational_impact:
    daily_workflow_disruption: "HIGH"
    data_integrity_risk: "MEDIUM"
    user_productivity_impact: "HIGH"
  rationale: |
    While deployment is functional, missing operational resilience testing
    creates risk of unplanned downtime that could significantly impact the
    10-user team's daily operations.

recommendations:
  immediate_actions:
    - "Validate Docker health checks and auto-restart behavior"
    - "Test data persistence with controlled VM restart"
    - "Create operational runbook for common failure scenarios"
    - "Implement basic monitoring for service availability"

  development_additions:
    - "Add comprehensive health check endpoints using OpenProject's built-in checks"
    - "Implement resource monitoring scripts for VM"
    - "Create automated backup testing procedures"
    - "Add performance testing to deployment pipeline"

quality_metrics:
  requirements_coverage: "70%" # Basic requirements met but operational gaps
  operational_readiness: "40%" # Major gaps in resilience testing
  test_completeness: "55%" # Happy path covered, critical gaps in edge cases
  documentation_quality: "85%" # Good deployment documentation

gate_decision_criteria:
  pass_conditions:
    - "All Priority 1 issues resolved"
    - "Operational resilience tests passing"
    - "Clear recovery procedures documented"
    - "Performance requirements validated"

## MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS

dev_team_requirements:
  completion_criteria: |
    DEV TEAM: DO NOT RETURN TO QA UNTIL ALL TESTS BELOW ARE EXECUTED AND PASSING.

    ZERO TOLERANCE FOR HAPPY PATH TESTING. Every test must be executed exactly
    as specified with FULL EVIDENCE provided. Any attempt to shortcut or
    "simulate" these tests will result in IMMEDIATE RETRAIN.

  evidence_submission_format: |
    For EACH test, provide:
    1. Terminal/command output with timestamps
    2. Screenshots where specified
    3. Log files showing before/after state
    4. Written confirmation that ALL validation criteria were met

    Submit evidence in: /infrastructure/qa-evidence/story-1.1/

  test_execution_order: |
    EXECUTE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
    1. All immediate_mandatory_tests (container, database, error handling, tunnel)
    2. All performance_validation_tests (load testing, resource monitoring)
    3. All integration_validation_tests (health endpoints)

    ANY test failure requires fix and restart from beginning of failed category.

qa_validation_promise: |
  QA WILL INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY ALL TESTS. Any evidence of corner-cutting,
  simulation instead of actual execution, or incomplete testing will result
  in immediate story rejection and dev team retrain.

  Tests must demonstrate REAL failure scenarios and REAL recovery, not
  theoretical "it should work" scenarios.

failure_consequences: |
  - Incomplete evidence: Story rejected, full retest required
  - Happy path testing detected: Dev team retrain mandatory
  - Simulated vs actual testing: Story rejected, process review required
  - Missing any test: Story blocked until 100% completion

conclusion: |
  Story 1.1 deployment is functional but BLOCKED until ALL mandatory tests
  are executed with full evidence. NO SHORTCUTS. NO HAPPY PATHING.

  Dev team has explicit instructions and must execute every test exactly
  as specified or face retrain.

next_story_impact: |
  Story 1.2 is BLOCKED until Story 1.1 passes ALL operational tests.
  NO exceptions or parallel work allowed.
