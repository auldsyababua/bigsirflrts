# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.5: Configure Supabase Native Webhooks to Trigger n8n-cloud
schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "Configure Supabase Native Webhooks to Trigger n8n-cloud"
gate: "FAIL" # CRITICAL PRODUCTION FAILURES DISCOVERED
status_reason: "100% webhook failure rate in production. n8n workflow code expects 'table' at root level but Supabase sends it nested in 'body.table'. All 9 recent webhook executions failed with 'Unexpected table: undefined' error."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# CRITICAL PRODUCTION FAILURES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

    finding: "MONITORING BLIND TO FAILURES - Health checks use incorrect payload structure, hiding production issues"

    evidence: "webhook-monitor.js line 43-56 and webhook-health-check.sh line 39-49 use wrong format"

# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 3, high: 0, medium: 0, low: 0 }
  highest: critical
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix n8n workflow code to handle actual Supabase payload structure"
      - "Update all tests to use REAL database operations, not mocks"
      - "Fix monitoring health checks to detect actual failures"
    monitor:
      - "Track webhook success rate after fixes"
      - "Verify no data loss from failed webhooks"

# NFR Validation - ALL FAILING
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Error responses leak internal structure. No proper error handling for malformed payloads."
  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Cannot meet <1 second requirement when webhooks are failing 100% of the time"
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Zero reliability - complete production failure with no recovery mechanism"
  maintainability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Tests don't catch real issues. Monitoring doesn't detect failures. Code/tests/monitoring all use different payload structures."

# Evidence of Testing Failures
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 675 # Lines of test code
  risks_identified: 3 # All critical
  real_failures_tested: 0 # ZERO real failure scenarios tested
  mocked_tests: 100% # ALL tests use mocks instead of real scenarios
  production_failures: 9 # Recent failed webhook executions
  trace:
    ac_covered: [] # No ACs actually covered due to production failure
    ac_gaps: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] # ALL acceptance criteria failing

# Developer Team Requirements - MANDATORY
dev_team_requirements:
  ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY: |
    NO HAPPY PATH TESTING ACCEPTED. Every test must simulate REAL failure conditions.

    CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
    1. Fix n8n workflow immediately - change line 7 from webhookData.table to webhookData.body.table
    2. Rewrite ALL tests to use REAL Supabase database operations, not mocked payloads
    3. Update monitoring to match actual payload structure
    4. Add tests that verify ACTUAL webhook delivery through complete pipeline
    5. Test with REAL invalid data, not simulated responses

    UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICES FOUND:
    - Mocking webhook payloads instead of triggering real database changes
    - Testing with fake data that doesn't match production structure
    - Monitoring that passes while production fails
    - No verification of actual end-to-end flow
    - Generic error messages that don't help operations team

    MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
    - All tests must use REAL Supabase â†’ n8n flow
    - Error messages must be SPECIFIC: "Webhook payload missing 'body.table' field" not "Unexpected table: undefined"
    - Tests must demonstrate ACTUAL webhook delivery and processing
    - Recovery procedures must be tested with REAL failures
    - QA will independently reproduce ALL scenarios with actual database operations

    DO NOT RETURN until:
    1. Production webhook failures are fixed (0% failure rate)
    2. All tests use REAL database triggers, not mocks
    3. Monitoring detects ACTUAL failures
    4. Error messages guide team to specific solutions
    5. Recovery procedures tested with REAL webhook failures

# Final Assessment
waiver: { active: false } # CANNOT BE WAIVED - PRODUCTION IS BROKEN

# QA VERDICT: Story 1.5 is experiencing complete production failure. The integration
# exists but is fundamentally broken due to payload structure mismatch. All recent
# webhooks are failing. Tests are not testing real scenarios. Monitoring is not
# detecting failures. This is a CRITICAL FAILURE requiring immediate hotfix.
