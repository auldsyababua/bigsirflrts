test_execution_notes: |
  Test suite designed with adversarial mindset to prevent test gaming.
  Includes both positive and negative test scenarios.
  Post-migration tests are conditional (RUN_POST_MIGRATION=true).
  Tests require DB_PASS environment variable to be set.
  SSH tests will fail gracefully if no SSH access available.
