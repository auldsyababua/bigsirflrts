# Validation Tools Added During Story Development

  context: |
    During INFRA-002 development, we encountered Docker build failures due to missing
    Dockerfiles and out-of-sync package-lock.json files. These issues prompted the
    addition of several validation tools to catch configuration problems early:

    1. Docker Configuration Validator - Prevents missing Dockerfile errors
    2. Environment Variable Validator - Catches .env file issues
    3. Test Environment Validator - Ensures CI/test environment consistency
    4. Dependency Checker (depcheck) - Finds unused/missing dependencies

    These tools were critical in resolving the "tsc not found" and "npm ci" errors
    that blocked the initial Docker builds for nlp-service.
  tools_added:
    - name: "validate-docker-config.sh"
      purpose: "Validates Docker configurations before build"
      catches: ["Missing Dockerfiles", "Out-of-sync package-lock.json"]
    - name: "validate-env.sh"
      purpose: "Validates environment variable files"
      catches: ["Duplicate keys", "Empty required values", "Format issues"]
    - name: "validate-test-env.sh"
      purpose: "Validates test environment matches CI"
      catches: ["Environment mismatches", "Incorrect test skip conditions"]
    - name: "depcheck"
      purpose: "Dependency validation"
      catches: ["Unused packages", "Missing dependencies", "Phantom dependencies"]
