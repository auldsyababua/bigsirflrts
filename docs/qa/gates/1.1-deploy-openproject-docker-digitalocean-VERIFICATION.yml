  COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE VERIFIED - READY FOR EXECUTION

  Dev team has successfully created ALL 7 mandatory test scripts addressing every QA gate
  requirement. Tests demonstrate real failure scenarios with actual recovery validation.
  No happy path shortcuts detected. Test suite is properly structured with evidence
  collection. Gate will move to PASS only after successful execution with evidence.

critical_observations:
  strengths:
    - All 7 mandatory tests created exactly as specified
    - Real failure scenarios with actual service disruption
    - Comprehensive evidence collection framework
    - Proper OpenProject health endpoint usage
    - Apache Bench load testing properly configured
    - VM reboot test includes data persistence validation
    - Master orchestration script handles all tests

  execution_requirements:
    - Tests must be run on actual Digital Ocean VM
    - Test 2 requires manual VM reboot intervention
    - Apache Bench must be installed for Test 5
    - Total execution time ~55 minutes
    - SSH access required to VM

gate_decision_criteria:
  tests_created: "✅ COMPLETE - All 7 tests exist and verified"
  anti_happy_path: "✅ CONFIRMED - Real failures, no shortcuts"
  evidence_framework: "✅ VERIFIED - Comprehensive logging in place"
  best_practices: "✅ VALIDATED - OpenProject health checks correct"

  pending_for_pass:
    - Actual execution of all tests on VM
    - Evidence files generated and reviewed
    - All tests must pass validation criteria
    - No test failures or errors
    - Performance metrics within requirements

execution_instructions:
  step_1: |
    Deploy tests to VM:
    ./infrastructure/qa-evidence/story-1.1/DEPLOY_TO_VM.sh

  step_2: |
    SSH to VM and execute:
    cd /root/infrastructure/qa-evidence/story-1.1
    ./RUN_ALL_TESTS.sh

  step_3: |
    For Test 2 (database persistence):
    - Run test preparation
    - Execute: sudo reboot
    - Wait for VM restart
    - Run verification script

  step_4: |
    Collect evidence from:
    - test-*-evidence.log files
    - Performance reports
    - test-summary.md

qa_architect_assessment: |
  The dev team has successfully addressed ALL mandatory QA requirements by creating
  a comprehensive test suite with real failure scenarios. The tests are properly
  structured, use actual service disruptions (not simulations), and include full
  evidence collection.

  Key validations:
  1. OpenProject health endpoints match official documentation
  2. Apache Bench load testing configured for 95th percentile validation
  3. Docker kill/stop commands create real failures
  4. VM reboot test includes actual system restart
  5. Evidence collection automated with timestamps

  This test suite meets QA standards for anti-happy-path testing. Upon successful
  execution with passing results, Story 1.1 gate status will change to PASS.

risk_assessment:
  execution_risks:
    - VM might not recover from reboot (low probability)
    - Network issues could affect test results
    - Resource constraints during load testing

  mitigation:
    - Snapshot VM before test execution
    - Run tests during low-traffic period
    - Monitor VM console during execution

final_determination: |
  GATE STATUS: PENDING_EXECUTION_VERIFICATION

  Test suite is APPROVED for structure and approach. Dev team has met all
  test creation requirements. Gate will automatically move to PASS upon:

  1. Successful execution of all 7 tests
  2. Evidence files demonstrating real execution
  3. All validation criteria met
  4. Performance within specified thresholds

  Dev team should proceed with test execution immediately and provide
  evidence package for final verification.

next_steps:
  immediate: "Execute test suite on Digital Ocean VM"
  upon_completion: "Submit evidence package for review"
  gate_transition: "PASS status upon successful execution"
  story_1_2: "Unblocked after execution verification"
