  CRITICAL FAILURES DISCOVERED DURING TESTING

  Despite comprehensive test suite creation, actual execution reveals MULTIPLE
  CRITICAL FAILURES that block Story 1.1 from passing QA gate:

  1. PERFORMANCE FAILURE: 95th percentile response time is 1322ms (REQUIRED: <200ms)
  2. WORKER FAILURE: Background job workers not running (health check fails)
  3. JOB QUEUE FAILURE: 2+ jobs stuck in queue for >5 minutes

  STORY 1.1 FAILS QA GATE

  While the test suite creation was excellent, actual testing reveals
  CRITICAL OPERATIONAL FAILURES that prevent production readiness:

  1. Application is 6.6x SLOWER than required (1322ms vs 200ms)
  2. Background workers NOT RUNNING - core functionality broken
  3. Jobs stuck in queue - async operations failing
  4. Cannot execute full test suite - VM access not configured

  These are not minor issues - they represent fundamental failures
  in meeting the story's acceptance criteria. A 10-user internal
  tool cannot function with these problems.

  The dev team must fix ALL Priority 1 issues and provide evidence
  of successful test execution before resubmission.

gate_transition_requirements:
  to_achieve_pass:
    - "Performance: 95th percentile < 200ms verified"
    - "Workers: All health checks passing"
    - "Queue: No backed up jobs"
    - "Access: QA can execute all tests on VM"
    - "Evidence: All 7 tests executed with passing results"

story_impact:
  story_1_1: "BLOCKED - Critical failures must be resolved"
  story_1_2: "BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until 1.1 passes"
  epic_1: "AT RISK - Foundation story failing"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Dev team must fix worker process issues"
    - "Dev team must optimize performance"
    - "Dev team must provide SSH access to QA"

  then:
    - "Re-execute all tests with evidence"
    - "Provide performance optimization details"
    - "Document worker configuration"

  finally:
    - "Resubmit for QA review with all fixes"

conclusion: |
  Story 1.1 FAILS due to critical operational failures discovered during
  testing. Performance is 6.6x slower than required, background workers
  are not running, and the full test suite cannot be executed.

  These are not theoretical concerns - they are actual failures that
  would severely impact the 10-user team's daily operations.

  NO STORY PROGRESSION until these issues are resolved.
