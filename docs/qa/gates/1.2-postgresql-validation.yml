dev_team_requirements:
  ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY: |
    NO HAPPY PATH TESTING ACCEPTED. Every test must simulate REAL failure conditions.

    UNACCEPTABLE EXAMPLES:
    - Mocking network failures instead of killing actual connections
    - Testing with fake credentials instead of real invalid ones
    - Simulating timeouts instead of waiting for real timeout behavior
    - Generic error messages like "connection failed"
    - Tests that can't fail under real conditions

    MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
    - All tests must use REAL Supabase instance with REAL failure scenarios
    - Error messages must be SPECIFIC and actionable for non-technical team
    - Tests must demonstrate ACTUAL recovery behavior, not assumed behavior
    - QA will independently verify all tests by reproducing exact failure conditions

    DO NOT RETURN until:
    1. Every test passes REAL failure simulation
    2. Error messages guide actual team members to solutions
    3. Recovery procedures work in practice, not theory

    QA WILL CATCH FAKE TESTING and team will be retrained.
