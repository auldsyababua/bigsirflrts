critical_finding: |
  MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION ERROR DETECTED: Story requires "OpenProject deployed to Cloudflare Workers" 
  but actual implementation is local Docker deployment at localhost:8080. This represents a 
  fundamental misunderstanding of requirements and complete failure to meet acceptance criteria.
  Previous QA assessment incorrectly marked as CONCERNS instead of FAIL.
