# QA Gate: Risk, testing, and operational readiness snapshot for a single story.
# Use inline comments to explain scoring/decisions; avoid redundant noise.
# Key semantics:
# - gate: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL (CONCERNS = proceed only with mitigations)
# - quality_score: 100 - (20*FAILs) - (10*CONCERNS) across NFRs and major categories
# - expires: ISO-8601 timestamp when this assessment must be revisited
