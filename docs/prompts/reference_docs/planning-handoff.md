# Planning Agent Session Handoff

**From**: Repository Reorganization Planning Session (2025-10-16)
**To**: Next Planning Agent
**Context**: Full repository cleanup ready for execution

---

## What Was Completed This Session

### PR #153 Safety Review & Fixes ✅

**Commits**: 62dcc31, 5b1e7f7

1. **Reviewed ALL PR #153 comments** (CodeRabbit AI)
   - Used Tracking Agent to pull all comments from GitHub
   - Analysis: `docs/.scratch/pr-153-review/all-comments.md`
   - Found 3 "critical" issues (acceptable - archived code is reference-only)

2. **Fixed Documentation Accuracy**
   - Updated `tests/archive/deprecated-stack/ARCHIVE-README.md`
   - Changed "3 files" → "6 files archived"
   - Documented 3 missing test files with rationale

3. **Added Non-Functional Warnings**
   - `packages/archive/sync-service/src/index.ts` - warning header
   - `packages/archive/sync-service/src/__tests__/config.test.ts` - warning header
   - Clear messaging: archived code contains broken references, won't execute

4. **Removed Duplicate flrts_extensions/**
   - 20 files removed from monorepo
   - External repo location documented in .project-context.md:
     - Local: `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/flrts-extensions`
     - GitHub: `auldsyababua/flrts-extensions`
   - Added to .gitignore

**Decision**: App never shipped, no production users. Archived code = historical reference only per .project-context.md.

### Full Repository Reorganization Planning ✅

**Commit**: 96a318d

**Completed Work Blocks:**

#### WB1: Deep Forensic Audit (Research Agent)
- Analyzed all 23 root items + deep subdirectory analysis
- Classification: Active/Obsolete/One-Off/Misplaced
- Git history analysis for every file
- Dependency checks (imports, package.json references)
- **Output**: `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/forensic-audit-report.md`

**Key Findings:**
- 25+ obsolete files (migration scripts, deprecated infrastructure)
- 10 one-off migration scripts
- 15 misplaced files
- 2 temporary files tracked in git (should be gitignored)

#### WB2: Migration Mapping Document (Action Agent)
- 45 items catalogued with breadcrumb IDs (ARCH-001 through ARCH-015)
- Complete traceability: original path → new path → reason
- 12 execution phases with exact bash commands
- Recovery instructions for every item
- **Output**: `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/migration-mapping.md`

**Breadcrumb System:**
- ARCH-001 through ARCH-015: Primary archives
- Sub-items: ARCH-001a through ARCH-001g (Supabase migrations)
- DEL-001, DEL-002: Deletions
- CONS-001 through CONS-006: Consolidations
- REORG-001 through REORG-004: Reorganizations
- EVAL-001 through EVAL-005: Items pending decision

#### WB3: Archive Breadcrumbs (Action Agent)
- 4 NEW archive READMEs created
- 2 EXISTING archive READMEs updated
- Every archived directory has metadata, file inventory, recovery instructions

**Archive READMEs Created:**
1. `docs/archive/supabase-migrations/ARCHIVE-README.md` (ARCH-001)
2. `docs/archive/scripts/linear-migration/ARCHIVE-README.md` (ARCH-002 through ARCH-006)
3. `docs/archive/scripts/cloudflare/ARCHIVE-README.md` (ARCH-007 through ARCH-009)
4. `docs/archive/scripts/infrastructure/ARCHIVE-README.md` (ARCH-010 through ARCH-012)
5. `docs/archive/scripts/ARCHIVE-README.md` (updated with ARCH-013, ARCH-014)
6. `packages/archive/ARCHIVE-README.md` (updated with flrts-extension ARCH-015)

#### WB4: Update .project-context.md
- Added "Repository Reorganization" section
- Documented planning completion status
- Included recovery instructions reference
- Cross-referenced to planning documents

## Ready for Execution: Full Repository Reorganization

### Planning Documents

**All documents committed and pushed:**

1. **Forensic Audit Report**
   - Path: `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/forensic-audit-report.md`
   - Contents: Complete analysis of 23 root items, classification, git history
   - Size: Comprehensive (covers all files)

2. **Migration Mapping**
   - Path: `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/migration-mapping.md`
   - Contents: 45 items mapped, 12 execution phases, breadcrumb lookup table
   - Ready to execute: All bash commands included

3. **Archive READMEs**
   - Locations: docs/archive/* and packages/archive/*
   - Contents: Metadata, file inventories, recovery instructions
   - Breadcrumbs: ARCH-001 through ARCH-015 fully documented

### Execution Plan Summary

**Impact:**
- Root directory: 23 → ~17 items (~26% reduction)
- Archives: 25+ files
- Deletions: 2 temporary files
- Consolidations: 6 items
- Reorganizations: 4 items

**Phases (12 total):**

**Low Risk (Safe to Execute):**
- Phase 1: Delete temporary files (tmp-sec.log, security-findings.json)
- Phase 2: Update .gitignore patterns
- Phases 3-9: Archive obsolete code (Supabase migrations, Linear scripts, Cloudflare, infrastructure, browser extension)
- Phase 12: Final .gitignore cleanup

**Medium Risk (Requires Testing):**
- Phases 10-11: Consolidations (lib/, infrastructure/scripts/, config/linting/)
  - Need to update package.json references
  - Run tests after each consolidation

**High Risk (Pending Decision):**
- EVAL-001 through EVAL-005: Items requiring Planning Agent approval
  - packages/nlp-service/ (uses deprecated OpenProject/Supabase - refactor or archive?)
  - scripts/linear-cli.js, linear-webhook.js (still used?)
  - scripts/maintenance/ scripts (still used?)

### Files to Reference

**Planning Documents:**
- `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/forensic-audit-report.md` - Full analysis
- `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/migration-mapping.md` - Execution guide
- `.project-context.md` - Updated with recovery instructions

**Archive Documentation:**
- 6 ARCHIVE-README.md files with full metadata
- Every archive has breadcrumb ID for traceability

**PR Context:**
- `docs/.scratch/pr-153-review/all-comments.md` - CodeRabbit review analysis

## Next Steps for Next Planning Agent

### Option A: Execute Full Reorganization

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Spawn Action Agent with Phase 1 (deletions)
2. Test, commit
3. Spawn Action Agent with Phases 2-9 (archives)
4. Test, commit
5. Spawn Action Agent with Phases 10-11 (consolidations)
6. Update package.json, run tests, commit
7. Evaluate EVAL-001 through EVAL-005 with user

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes (mostly Action Agent execution)

### Option B: Phased Review

Execute low-risk phases first, review results, then proceed with medium-risk phases.

### Option C: User Review First

Present migration-mapping.md to user for approval of specific phases before execution.

---

## Critical Context

### App Status (from .project-context.md)

**Key Fact**: App has **never shipped**, no production users, no active usage.

**Deprecated Technologies** (all archived):
- OpenProject (hosting shut down Sep 30, 2025)
- Supabase as primary backend (migrated to ERPNext)
- sync-service (no longer needed)
- DigitalOcean infrastructure
- AWS X-Ray SDK (replaced with OpenTelemetry)

**Archived code = historical reference only**

### Recovery System

If anything goes wrong during execution:
1. Check `docs/.scratch/deep-audit/migration-mapping.md` for breadcrumb ID
2. Every archive has ARCHIVE-README.md with original path
3. Git history fully preserved
4. Rollback: `git checkout <commit> -- <original-path>`

### Testing Requirements

After each consolidation phase:
- Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration` (if services available)
- Run security review: `scripts/security-review.sh`
- Check imports: Verify no broken references

---

## Known Issues/Blockers

**None** - All planning complete, ready for execution.

**Pending Decisions (EVAL items):**
- nlp-service package (refactor for ERPNext or archive?)
- Linear integration scripts (still needed?)
- Maintenance scripts (still used?)

**User approval required**: Final decision on execution approach (Option A, B, or C)

---

## Success Criteria

**Planning Phase (COMPLETE ✅)**:
- [x] Forensic audit complete (all files categorized)
- [x] Migration mapping document created
- [x] User context provided (app never shipped)
- [x] All ARCHIVE-README.md files created
- [x] .project-context.md updated with recovery reference
- [x] All planning artifacts committed and pushed

**Execution Phase (PENDING USER APPROVAL)**:
- [ ] Phase 1: Deletions executed
- [ ] Phases 2-9: Archives executed
- [ ] Phases 10-11: Consolidations executed (with tests)
- [ ] Phase 12: .gitignore updated
- [ ] EVAL items decided
- [ ] Repository reduced to ~17 root items
- [ ] Full traceability maintained

## Token Budget

**Session Usage**: ~118K tokens (out of 200K budget)
**Remaining**: ~82K tokens available for execution

**Next Planning Agent**: Full context budget available - can execute all 12 phases if needed.

---

**Status**: Planning complete, all artifacts committed and pushed to `chore/directory-cleanup`. Ready for user approval and execution.
