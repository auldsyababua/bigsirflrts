# Planning Agent Handoff — Session Summary (2025-10-04)

## Completed Work
- Stage 4 (10N-235) fully verified: repository sweeps logged, doc navigation confirmed, Claude workflow health checked, Stage 5 announcement draft captured at `docs/.scratch/10n-235-stage-4/stage-5-announcement-draft.md`.
- ADR-003 reclassified as historical (commit `f6ece05`) to reflect managed MariaDB on Frappe Cloud.
- Follow-up Linear issues opened: 10N-251 (workflow check naming/branch protection) and 10N-252 (archive tunnel monitoring scripts).
- Lessons Learned added to 10N-235 (Phase 4) plus prior issues; prompts already updated earlier to enforce new checklists.

## In-Flight / Pending Coordination
- Stage 4 close-out: Coordinator review needed to publish Stage 5 announcement to 10N-233, archive `docs/.scratch/10n-235-stage-4/`, and mark 10N-235 Done.
- Stage 5 verification issues queued: 10N-240 (repo verification) and 10N-242 (documentation/communications) still in backlog.
- 10N-241 (application code refactor for ERPNext backend) remains Not Started and is prerequisite for retiring legacy OpenProject/Supabase code paths.

## Next Actions for Incoming Planning Agent
1. Review the Stage 5 announcement draft and, once approved, post it to the 10N-233 epic; then archive the scratch directory and transition 10N-235 to Done.
2. Prepare execution prompts for Stage 5 issues (10N-240, 10N-242) – leverage the repository sweep command list already logged.
3. Prioritize staffing for 10N-241 to begin the application-code refactor now that documentation/Linear backlog is aligned.
4. Monitor follow-up tickets 10N-251 and 10N-252; ensure they are scheduled before expanding CI or infra docs.

## Risks / Watch Items
- Legacy Supabase/OpenProject code remains until 10N-241 executes; prolonged delay increases drift risk.
- Claude workflow prompt still references Supabase/N8N (documented during Phase 4); update scheduled via 10N-251.
- Ensure Lessons Learned sections continue to be populated for every closed issue (spot check during planning reviews).

## Reminders
- Continue enforcing the five-phase loop (Research -> Prototype -> Validate -> Implement -> Archive) and required checklists in action/QA prompts.
- Keep branch protection aligned with actual workflow names (per 10N-251) and monitor Anthropic credit usage.
- Before starting new execution work, confirm prompts reference ADR-006, updated docs, and the new archival patterns.
