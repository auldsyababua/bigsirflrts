## CRITICAL CONTEXT (Not in Linear)

### Work Completed This Session ✅

**Phase 3: Deploy flrts-extensions (COMPLETE)**
- **WB#4**: Researcher Agent investigated persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` deployment failures
  - Root cause: Missing root-level `__init__.py` in flrts-extensions repo
  - Documented in `docs/.scratch/10n-228/frappe-structure-analysis.md`
- **WB#5**: Action Agent added root `__init__.py` (commit e3a67fc, PR #3)
- **Tracking**: Deployment succeeded (deploy-27276-000005), all steps passed
- **10N-275 Dashboard**: WB#1 marked complete

**Agent Framework Updates (COMPLETE)**
- **WB#2**: Action Agent updated `action-agent.md` with Handoff Intake/Output sections
- **WB#3**: QA Agent updated `qa-agent.md` with Handoff Intake/Output sections
- **10N-275 Dashboard**: WB#2 and WB#3 marked complete

**Git Status**: On branch main, clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Complete WB#6 Phase 4 - Site Configuration & Secrets

**Task**: Test API authentication with existing keys
**Agent**: action-agent (for API test) or planning-agent (user verification)
**Issue**: 10N-275 WB#6 (parent: 10N-228)
**Status**: In Progress
**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Critical Information**:
- ⚠️ **SECRETS POLICY**: Project uses **env-based secrets only** (local `.env`, Frappe Cloud Bench Env GUI)
- ⚠️ **NO 1PASSWORD**: Do NOT reference 1Password CLI or tools - this is outdated and incorrect
- ⚠️ **Frappe Cloud SSH**: Read-only debugging access only - all configuration must be done via GUI
- User already has API keys in `.env` (lines 25-26):
  ```
  ERPNEXT_ADMIN_API_KEY=dbf4bb1b556e3d2
  ERPNEXT_ADMIN_API_SECRET=f6097d1b5069034
  ```

**Remaining Steps**:
1. Verify user has added `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Frappe Cloud **Bench Group → Env tab** (GUI)
   - Location: Frappe Cloud Dashboard → Bench Groups → bigsirflrts-prod → Env tab
   - NOT in Site Config, NOT via SSH
2. Test API authentication:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://ops.10nz.tools/api/resource/User" \
     -H "Authorization: token dbf4bb1b556e3d2:f6097d1b5069034"
   ```
3. If test passes, mark WB#6 complete and proceed to Phase 6

**Next Agent**: Planning or Action agent to verify env vars added and test API

### Priority 2: Phase 6 - Integration Setup (After WB#6 Complete)

**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 complete (API auth working)

**Task**: Configure Telegram webhook
**Agent**: action-agent or browser-agent (depends on configuration method)
**Issue**: Create new work block in 10N-275 for Phase 6

**Key Details**:
- Webhook URL: `https://ops.10nz.tools/api/method/flrts_extensions.automations.telegram_api.handle_telegram_webhook`
- Test webhook functionality after configuration

### Priority 3: Phase 7 - Post-Deployment Verification (After Phase 6 Complete)

**Prerequisites**: Phase 6 complete (Telegram webhook configured)

**Task**: Smoke tests and verification
**Agent**: action-agent or qa-agent
**Issue**: Create new work block in 10N-275 for Phase 7

**Key Details**:
- Smoke tests for all critical functions
- Verify scheduler and background workers
- Verify automated backups appear

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: Env-Based Secrets Only (Session 4)

**Rationale**: User explicitly corrected multiple 1Password references
**Critical User Feedback**: "also please remember we are not using 1password! i dont know where you got this from as this should be purged from documentation - we are using env based secret storage and secrets in the cloud"

**Implementation**:
- Local development: `.env` file in project root
- Frappe Cloud: Bench Group → Env tab (GUI)
- NO 1Password CLI or tools

**Documentation Impact**: Multiple docs need cleanup (see Deferred Issues)

### Decision 2: GUI-Only Configuration for Frappe Cloud (Session 4)

**Blocker**: Initial approach suggested SSH-based configuration
**User Correction**: "ssh for frappe cloud is only for debugging. We need to do this in the gui"

**Implementation**:
- All Frappe Cloud configuration via web dashboard
- SSH access for debugging only (read-only)
- Bench Group → Env tab for environment variables

### Decision 3: API Keys Already Exist (Session 4)

**Discovery**: User already has ERPNext admin API keys in `.env` (lines 25-26)
**Impact**: No need to generate new keys through ERPNext UI
**User Correction**: "we already have admin keys. They are in the .env - line 25"

**Result**: Simplified Phase 4 to just adding env vars + testing authentication

### Decision 4: Deferred Linear GitHub Mapping Fix (Session 4)

**Issue**: All 10N team projects syncing to BigSirFLRTS repo instead of correct repos
**Root Cause**: Linear maps repos at TEAM level, not project level
**User Decision**: "ok can we continue with the next job for bigsirflrts. At least that is setup correctly"

**Implementation**:
- Created browser agent instructions: `docs/.scratch/linear-github-mapping/handoffs/planning-to-browser-instructions.md`
- Deferred to continue with BigSirFLRTS deployment
- User will request when ready to address

## HANDOFF FILES TO CHECK (Next Planning Session)

**Active Handoffs**:
- `docs/.scratch/linear-github-mapping/handoffs/planning-to-browser-instructions.md` - Browser agent task ready, deferred by user

**No Immediate Handoffs Expected**:
- Pull-based workflow active for BigSirFLRTS deployment
- Next planning agent should read 10N-275 WB#6 for current status
- If WB#6 Status="In Progress", verify env vars added and test API auth
- If WB#6 Status="Complete", proceed to Phase 6

---

## DEFERRED ISSUES

**Linear GitHub Repository Mapping** (medium priority)
- **Issue**: All 10N team projects syncing to BigSirFLRTS repo instead of correct repos
- **Root Cause**: Linear maps repos at TEAM level, not project level
- **Browser Instructions**: `docs/.scratch/linear-github-mapping/handoffs/planning-to-browser-instructions.md`
- **Status**: User chose to defer and continue with BigSirFLRTS deployment
- **Action Needed**: Browser agent task when user requests
- **Screenshots Available**:
  - Frappe Cloud Env tab (empty): Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.56.46 PM
  - Linear projects list: Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 9.37.12 AM
  - Frappe Cloud site config: Screenshot 2025-10-14 at 4.06.09 PM

**Documentation Cleanup** (low priority)
- **Issue**: Multiple docs reference 1Password incorrectly
- **User Feedback**: "also please remember we are not using 1password! i dont know where you got this from as this should be purged from documentation"
- **Solution**: Systematic replacement with env-based approach
- **Files to Update**:
  - `docs/.scratch/10n-228/deployment-plan.md` (Phase 4 section, lines 498-573)
  - Any other docs mentioning 1Password (search: `rg "1Password" docs/`)
- **Priority**: Low (doesn't block deployment)

---

## BLOCKERS / QUESTIONS

**Current Blocker (WB#6)**:
- Awaiting user to add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Frappe Cloud Bench Group → Env tab
- User was in process of doing this when handoff protocol was requested
- Once complete, need to test API authentication

**No Other Blockers**:
- Clear path forward for Phase 6 and Phase 7
- All deployment issues resolved
- API keys exist and ready to test

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Lesson 1: Check Existing Resources Before Generating New Ones (Session 4)

**Issue**: Initially suggested generating new API keys through ERPNext UI
**Reality**: User already has API keys in `.env` file (lines 25-26)
**User Correction**: "we already have admin keys. They are in the .env - line 25"
**Prevention**: Always check existing `.env`, config files, and environment variables before suggesting generation of new credentials

### Lesson 2: Verify Platform Policies Before Suggesting Approaches (Session 4)

**Issue**: Suggested SSH-based configuration for Frappe Cloud
**Reality**: Frappe Cloud SSH is read-only debugging access; all config via GUI
**User Correction**: "ssh for frappe cloud is only for debugging. We need to do this in the gui"
**Prevention**: Research platform-specific policies before suggesting implementation approaches

### Lesson 3: Listen to User Corrections About Tooling (Session 4)

**Issue**: Referenced 1Password multiple times despite no evidence in codebase
**User Correction**: "also please remember we are not using 1password! i dont know where you got this from as this should be purged from documentation"
**Root Cause**: Possibly hallucinated from deployment-plan.md outdated references
**Prevention**: Trust user corrections about project tooling choices; update documentation proactively

### Lesson 4: UI Location Corrections (Session 4)

**Issue**: Suggested wrong UI location for environment variables (Site Config)
**Reality**: Environment variables go in Bench Group → Env tab
**User Correction**: "are you sure its not in the Bench group env?" (with screenshot)
**Prevention**: When suggesting GUI navigation, provide screenshots of expected UI or ask user to verify location first

### Lesson 5: Frappe Structure Requirements (Session 4)

**Discovery**: Frappe requires both root-level `__init__.py` AND app-level `__init__.py`
**Blocker**: Missing root `__init__.py` caused `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flrts_extensions.flrts_extensions'`
**Solution**: Researcher Agent deep dive identified pattern; Action Agent added 3-line file
**Prevention**: Research framework-specific requirements before deployment (Frappe double-nested structure is non-standard)

### Lesson 6: Linear MCP Authentication (Session 4)

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" errors when calling Linear MCP tools
**Solution**: User ran `/mcp` command to re-authenticate
**Prevention**: When seeing Linear MCP auth errors, suggest `/mcp` command immediately

### Lesson 7: User Deferrals Are Valid Priorities (Session 4)

**Context**: User raised Linear GitHub mapping issue mid-deployment
**User Decision**: "ok can we continue with the next job for bigsirflrts. At least that is setup correctly"
**Response**: Created browser agent instructions but deferred execution per user request
**Lesson**: Respect user priority shifts; document deferred work but don't auto-execute
