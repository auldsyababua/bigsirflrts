## CRITICAL CONTEXT (Not in Linear)

### Work Completed This Session ✅

**Session 1 (Earlier Today)**:
- Created browser-agent.md (650+ lines)
- Updated 4 reference docs for browser agent integration
- Updated 10N-275 WB1 to address browser agent

**Session 2 (This Session)**:
- ✅ Browser agent attempted Frappe Cloud installation → **BLOCKER DISCOVERED**: Monorepo subdirectory not supported
- ✅ Research completed: Frappe Cloud requires apps in separate repos (Perplexity + ref.tools + official docs)
- ✅ Created WB6 in 10N-275: Tracking agent task to extract app to new repo `flrts-extensions`
- ✅ Updated 10N-228: Added handoff log, repository migration strategy, troubleshooting sections
- ✅ Updated browser-agent.md: Manual screenshot workflow (CMD+SHIFT+4, not automated)

**Git Status**: Clean working tree EXCEPT browser agent files still uncommitted (will be committed by tracking agent in WB6 Phase 1)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Monitor WB6 Completion (Tracking Agent)

**Task**: Extract flrts_extensions to separate GitHub repo
**Agent**: Tracking
**Issue**: 10N-275 WB6
**Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes
**Status**: Ready to execute (awaiting Colin to invoke tracking agent)

**Expected Deliverables**:
1. Feature branch: `feat/10n-228-browser-agent-and-app-extraction`
2. Browser agent commit (5 files)
3. New GitHub repo: `https://github.com/auldsyababua/flrts-extensions`
4. PR created with summary + test plan
5. Handoff: `docs/.scratch/10n-228/handoffs/tracking-to-planning-complete.md`

**Verification**:
- Check tracking handoff file for completion status
- Verify new repo exists and has commits
- Review PR for completeness
- Confirm no git safety issues (no force push to main)

### Priority 2: Retry Frappe Cloud Installation (Browser Agent)

**Prerequisites**: WB6 complete, new repo URL available

**Task**: Install flrts_extensions via Frappe Cloud Dashboard (retry with new repo)
**Agent**: Browser (Perplexity Comet)
**Repository**: `https://github.com/auldsyababua/flrts-extensions.git` (NEW)
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

**Instructions** (already in 10N-275 WB1, may need minor updates):
1. Navigate to https://frappecloud.com
2. Select site `builder-rbt-sjk.v.frappe.cloud`
3. Apps → Install from GitHub
4. Repository URL: `https://github.com/auldsyababua/flrts-extensions.git`
5. Branch: `main`
6. Wait for installation (2-5 minutes)
7. Verify app in installed apps list
8. Create handoff: `docs/.scratch/10n-228/handoffs/browser-to-planning-results.md`

**Manual Screenshots Required**:
- Use CMD+SHIFT+4 (macOS)
- Save to: `docs/.scratch/10n-228/screenshots/`
- Naming: `00-landing-page.png`, `01-authenticated.png`, etc.

### Priority 3: Resume 10N-228 Deployment (Action Agent)

**Prerequisites**: Frappe Cloud installation successful (browser agent PASS)

**Next Phases** (from 10N-228):
- Phase 4: Configure secrets via SSH (`bench set-config`)
- Phase 6: Set Telegram webhook
- Phase 7: Post-deployment verification (6/6 tests passing)

**Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes (SSH-based configuration)

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: Browser Agent Added to Ecosystem

**Rationale**: Frappe Cloud blocks SSH app installation (dashboard-only policy)
**Implementation**:
- Created browser-agent.md (manual web navigation via Perplexity Comet)
- Updated 4 reference docs: agent-handoff-rules, planning-agent, agent-addressing-system, planning-handoff
- Added Templates 8 & 9 to agent-handoff-rules (Planning↔Browser)

**Key Innovation**: **Adaptive Navigation**
- GUI paths in prompts are SUGGESTIONS (not guarantees)
- Browser must search/explore if UI differs from documentation
- Document actual path taken (helps update future instructions)

**Manual Screenshot Workflow** (discovered this session):
- Browser agent = Colin working manually in Perplexity Comet Browser
- NOT automated browser (no Selenium/Puppeteer)
- Screenshots via OS tools (CMD+SHIFT+4), saved directly to repo

### Decision 2: Extract flrts_extensions to Separate Repository

**Blocker**: Frappe Cloud cannot install from monorepo subdirectory
**Error**: "Not a valid Frappe App! Files setup.py or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml do not exist in app directory"

**Research** (Perplexity + ref.tools + official docs):
- ✅ Frappe Cloud requires apps in **separate Git repositories**
- ✅ `setup.py` must be at **root level** (not in subdirectory)
- ❌ No subdirectory support (cannot specify path within repo)
- ✅ Community confirms: Monorepo subdirectories not supported

**Solution**: Extract `/flrts_extensions/` to new repo
- **New Repository**: `https://github.com/auldsyababua/flrts-extensions`
- **Monorepo**: `flrts_extensions/` directory **remains for local development**
- **Deployment**: Use new repo for Frappe Cloud installation only

**References**:
- Frappe docs: https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/basics/apps
- Community: https://discuss.frappe.io/t/deploy-custom-app-to-frappe-cloud-erpnext/88966

### Decision 3: Tracking Agent Executes Extraction

**Rationale**: Extraction involves git/GitHub operations (tracking agent scope)
**Task**: WB6 in 10N-275 (30-40 minutes)

**6 Phases**:
1. Create feature branch + commit browser agent work
2. Extract app to `/tmp/` directory
3. Create GitHub repo via `gh` CLI
4. Initialize git + push to new repo
5. Return to bigsirflrts + push feature branch
6. Create PR with both browser agent work + extraction

**Safety Rules** (baked into WB6):
- NEVER force push to main/master
- Use `--force-with-lease` only if absolutely needed
- Verify all operations before pushing
- Stop and report blockers immediately

## GIT STATUS

**Current Branch**: `main`
**Uncommitted Changes**: Yes (5 browser agent files)
**Working Tree**: Modified but NOT dirty (all changes tracked)

**Tracking Agent Will**:
1. Create branch `feat/10n-228-browser-agent-and-app-extraction`
2. Commit browser agent files (first commit in Phase 1)
3. Extract app, create new repo, push
4. Push feature branch
5. Create PR

**Expected PR**: Browser agent + app extraction (single PR, atomic changes)

---

## LINEAR ISSUES STATUS

**10N-275** (Master Dashboard):
- WB1: ✅ Updated to address browser agent (Frappe Cloud installation)
- WB2: ✅ Complete (dashboard housekeeping)
- WB3: ✅ Complete (DigitalOcean archival)
- WB4-5: ⏳ Pending (agent handoff updates)
- WB6: ✅ **NEW** - Tracking agent repo extraction task (ready to execute)

**10N-228** (Provision ERPNext):
- Phase 1-2: ✅ Complete (site operational at https://ops.10nz.tools)
- Phase 3: ⏳ **BLOCKED** → Awaiting repo extraction (WB6)
- Phase 4-7: ⏳ Pending (after app installation succeeds)

**Status Summary**:
- Site: Operational ✅
- SSH: Configured ✅
- App: Blocked on repo extraction (WB6 will unblock)
- Next: Browser agent retry → SSH configuration → Verification

---

## HANDOFF FILES TO CHECK (Next Planning Session)

**Tracking Agent Completion**:
- `docs/.scratch/10n-228/handoffs/tracking-to-planning-complete.md`
- Expected: PR URL, new repo URL, commit hashes, verification outputs

**Browser Agent Results** (after WB6 complete):
- `docs/.scratch/10n-228/handoffs/browser-to-planning-results.md`
- Expected: Installation status (success/failure), screenshots, UI deviations

**Priority Order**:
1. Check tracking handoff first (repo extraction)
2. If tracking PASS → Check browser handoff (installation attempt)
3. If browser PASS → Route to action agent for Phase 4-7 (SSH config)

---

## BLOCKERS / QUESTIONS

**None.** Clear path forward:
1. Tracking agent executes WB6 (repo extraction)
2. Browser agent retries installation (new repo URL)
3. Action agent completes deployment (SSH configuration)

All architectural decisions made, research complete, tasks documented in Linear.

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Lesson 1: Browser Agent = Manual Workflow

**Issue**: Initial browser-agent.md assumed automated screenshot capture
**Impact**: Colin got stuck at screenshot step (Perplexity Comet Browser cannot automate)
**Fix**: Updated browser-agent.md to specify manual OS screenshot tools (CMD+SHIFT+4 macOS, Windows+Shift+S)
**Prevention**: Always clarify automation vs manual workflows when creating new agent types

### Lesson 2: GUI Documentation Volatility

**Issue**: Browser agent instructions assumed specific menu paths (Apps → Install App)
**Reality**: GUIs change frequently; hardcoded paths fail
**Solution**: Adaptive navigation pattern (treat paths as suggestions, search/explore if different)
**Documentation**: Browser agent template includes 5-step fallback strategy for finding UI elements

### Lesson 3: Platform Research Before Architecture Assumptions

**Issue**: Assumed Frappe Cloud would support monorepo subdirectories (like many modern platforms)
**Reality**: Frappe Cloud requires separate repos with root-level setup.py (no subdirectory support)
**Impact**: Wasted browser agent attempt, discovered blocker mid-deployment
**Fix**: Used Perplexity + ref.tools to research Frappe Cloud requirements, confirmed with official docs + community
**Prevention**: Research platform-specific requirements BEFORE creating deployment plans

### Lesson 4: File-Based Handoff System Works Well

**Observation**: Clear handoff chain today (Action→Planning→Browser→Planning→Research→Planning→Tracking)
**Success**: Each agent wrote structured handoffs to predetermined locations
**Value**: Next planning agent will have complete context via handoff files + Linear issues
**Recommendation**: Continue this pattern; add handoff file checks to planning agent intake routine

### Lesson 5: Tracking Agent for Git/GitHub Operations

**Rationale**: Planning agent has limited context window; git operations consume tokens
**Solution**: Delegate git/GitHub work to tracking agent (specialized, predictable operations)
**Implementation**: WB6 has 6 phases with copy-paste bash commands and safety rules
**Benefit**: Planning agent stays focused on coordination; tracking agent executes mechanically
