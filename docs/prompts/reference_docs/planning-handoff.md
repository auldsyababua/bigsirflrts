# Planning Agent Session Handoff

**From**: Schema Migration Completion Session (2025-10-20)
**To**: Next Planning Agent
**Context**: 10N-256 complete, pytest migration planned but not created in Linear

---

## What Was Completed This Session

### 10N-256: Schema Migration Strategy & Prototype ✅ COMPLETE

**Final Status**:
- ✅ QA Approved (15/15 tests passing - GREEN phase)
- ✅ PR #155 Created: https://github.com/auldsyababua/bigsirflrts/pull/155
- ✅ Linear Status: "Done"
- ✅ Deployed to Frappe Cloud production (ops.10nz.tools)

**Deliverables**:
- Mining Site DocType (4 fields)
- Contractor DocType (5 fields)
- Maintenance Visit custom fields (7 fields)
- Automated test suite (15 tests) in `tests/integration/10n-256-schema-migration.test.sh`

**Key Learning**:
- ERPNext custom fields require `/api/method/frappe.desk.form.load.getdoctype` endpoint (merged schema)
- NOT `/api/resource/DocType/X` (base schema only - missing custom fields)

**Git State**:
- Branch: `feat/10n-233-10n-256-schema-migration`
- Commits: 2 (RED phase, GREEN phase)
- Status: Clean, pushed to origin
- PR: Ready for review/merge

## Work Started But Not Completed

### Pytest Migration Work Block

**Status**: Structure prepared but Linear issues NOT created (Research Agent interrupted)

**What Exists**:
- ✅ Pytest prototype complete: `docs/.scratch/10n-256/pytest-prototype/`
  - 14 tests ported (100% parity with bash)
  - 10 files: tests, fixtures, config, documentation
  - Production-ready
- ✅ Linear issue structure prepared: `docs/.scratch/10n-256/linear-issue-structure.md`
  - Parent issue description ready
  - 4 child issues structured (review, setup, port, deprecate)
  - Master Dashboard entry ready

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Parent Linear issue not created
- ❌ Child issues not created
- ❌ Master Dashboard (10N-275) not updated with new Work Block

**Next Steps**:
1. Retry Research Agent task to create pytest migration Linear issues
2. Add Work Block to Master Dashboard 10N-275
3. Start Job 1: Review prototype and approve strategy

---

## Master Dashboard Update Required

**Issue**: 10N-275 (Master Dashboard)

**Required Updates** (Planning Agent responsibility):
1. ⏸️ Check off 10N-256 in Job List (if present - need to verify dashboard state)
2. ⏸️ Update Current Job marquee to next job
3. ⏸️ Add pytest migration Work Block (after Research creates parent/child issues)

**Note**: Linear API was intermittent during session (HTTP 500/502). Last successful update was 10N-256 status to "Done". Dashboard updates were not attempted.

---

## Current Git State

**Branch**: `feat/10n-233-10n-256-schema-migration`
**Status**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
**Remote**: Fully synced with origin

**Recent Commits**:
- `faccf7f`: GREEN phase - all 15 schema migration tests passing
- `994312a`: RED phase - TDD tests created

**PR Status**: #155 open, ready for review

---

## Critical Context

### Linear API Stability
Linear API experienced intermittent failures during session:
- HTTP 500/502 errors when creating issues
- Recovered after wait
- May affect issue creation/updates

**Workaround**: Retry failed operations after brief wait

### Pytest Migration Priority
Code review feedback (PR #155) identified bash-to-pytest migration as:
- **Impact**: High
- **Priority**: High
- Prototype is production-ready and waiting for approval

---

## Next Session Priorities

**Immediate**:
1. Review PR #155 for merge approval
2. Create pytest migration Linear issues (retry Research Agent task)
3. Update Master Dashboard with new Work Block

**Follow-up**:
4. User reviews pytest prototype
5. Proceed with pytest migration (Jobs 1-4)

---

## Known Issues/Blockers

**None** - All blockers resolved:
- ✅ SSH certificate renewed (was expiring)
- ✅ Custom field API visibility fixed
- ✅ Linear API recovered (was HTTP 500/502)
