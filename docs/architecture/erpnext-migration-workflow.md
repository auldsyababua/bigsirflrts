### Phase 1: Deep Research & Schema Philosophy (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Understand ERPNext schema philosophy and design patterns BEFORE
touching code

**Branch:** `feature/erpnext-adoption`

**Philosophy:** Research-heavy, low-code phase. Understand the "ERPNext way"
before mapping our needs to it.

**Linear Stories:**

- âœ… 10N-228: Deploy ERPNext dev instance
- âœ… 10N-229: Connect ERPNext to Supabase PostgreSQL
- âœ… 10N-230: Test ERPNext FSM module features

- [ ] **NEW:** Functional requirements mapping (business logic, not engineering)
- [ ] **NEW:** DocType design patterns study

#### 1.1: ERPNext Schema Philosophy Research

**Goal:** Understand how ERPNext organizes data and why

**Research Questions:**

1. **What is a DocType?**
   - How does it differ from a traditional database table?
   - What are the advantages of ERPNext's DocType system?
   - How do DocTypes relate to each other?

2. **ERPNext Naming Conventions:**
   - Why `tabWorkOrder` instead of `work_orders`?
   - How does ERPNext handle naming conflicts?
   - What are the reserved field names?

3. **Field Types and Validation:**
   - What field types does ERPNext support?
   - How does ERPNext handle validation vs PostgreSQL constraints?
   - How are relationships (FK equivalents) defined?

4. **Permission and Role Model:**

#### 1.2: Functional Requirements Mapping (Business-First)

**Goal:** Define what we NEED functionally, separate from how OpenProject did it

**Approach:** Forget OpenProject. Start from business requirements.

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **What are our actual business entities?**
   - Sites/Locations (what attributes do they NEED?)
   - Contractors (what do we track about them?)
   - Personnel (roles, contact info, what else?)
   - Work (tasks vs projects vs work orders - what's the difference for us?)

2. **What workflows do we need?**
   - How does work get created?
   - How does work get assigned?
   - What are the status transitions?
   - What triggers notifications?

3. **What reports do we need?**
   - Site activity summaries?
   - Contractor performance?
   - Work completion rates?
   - Time tracking?

4. **What integrations are critical?**
   - Telegram (input: create work)
   - n8n (automation: workflows)
   - Supabase (data: analytics/dashboards)
   - OpenAI (intelligence: parsing)

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/research/flrts-functional-requirements.md`
  - Business entity definitions (not technical tables)
  - Workflow diagrams (how work flows through system)
  - Required reports and analytics
  - Critical integration points
- **Document:** `docs/research/erpnext-feature-mapping.md`
  - Which ERPNext modules map to our needs
  - Which features we'll use immediately
  - Which features we'll grow into later

#### 1.3: DocType Design Patterns Study

**Goal:** Understand how to design DocTypes the "ERPNext way"

**Research Questions:**

1. **Standard DocType Patterns:**
   - What are common ERPNext DocType design patterns?
   - How do master DocTypes differ from transactional DocTypes?
   - How are child tables (line items) designed?

2. **ERPNext FSM Module Deep Dive:**
   - Study existing FSM DocTypes: Work Order, Location, Supplier
   - What fields are standard vs customizable?
   - How does ERPNext handle FSM-specific workflows?

3. **Customization Best Practices:**
   - When to extend existing DocTypes vs create new ones?
   - How to add custom fields without breaking upgrades?
   - What are the limits of customization?

4. **Real-World Examples:**
   - Find GitHub repos of ERPNext customizations
   - Study community apps extending ERPNext FSM
   - Learn from others' mistakes and successes

**Deliverables:**

  - Workflow analysis (how FSM works out of the box)

#### 1.4: Comprehensive Codebase Audit

**Goal:** Identify EVERY code change needed across all modules

**Approach:** Systematic audit using architecture docs and existing code

**Audit Methodology:**

1. **Review Architecture Documents:**
   - Read all docs in `docs/architecture/`
   - Identify every component that touches OpenProject
   - Map component â†’ files â†’ functions

2. **Code Search for OpenProject References:**

   ```bash
   # Find all OpenProject API calls
   rg "openproject" --type ts --type js -g '!node_modules'

   # Find all references to OpenProject tables
   rg "work_packages|projects|users" --type ts --type sql -g '!node_modules'

   # Find all OpenProject config variables
   rg "OPENPROJECT" --type env --type yaml
   ```

3. **Module-by-Module Audit:**
   - For each module in architecture docs:
     - List all files in module
     - Identify OpenProject dependencies
     - Document required changes (paths, imports, APIs, schemas)

4. **Create Change Inventory:**
   - Every file that needs modification
   - Every import/path that needs updating
   - Every API endpoint that needs changing
   - Every database query that needs rewriting

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/migration/codebase-audit-report.md`
  - Complete inventory of code changes needed
  - Organized by module and priority
  - Estimated effort for each change
- **Prompt Template:** `docs/prompts/module-migration-prompt.md`
  - Reusable prompt for migrating each module
  - Leverages audit report for context
  - Includes validation checklist

**Example Audit Output:**

```markdown
### Module: sync-service

**Files to Modify:**

1. `packages/sync-service/src/index.ts`
   - Change: Replace OpenProject API client with ERPNext client
   - Lines: 45-67, 89-102
   - Effort: 2 hours

2. `packages/sync-service/src/config.ts`
   - Change: Replace OPENPROJECT_URL with ERPNEXT_URL

   - Effort: 15 minutes

**New Files to Create:**

1. `packages/sync-service/src/erpnext-client.ts`
   - Purpose: ERPNext API wrapper
   - Effort: 4 hours

**Dependencies to Update:**

- Remove: `@openproject/api-client`
- Add: `@frappe/client` or custom ERPNext client
```

#### 1.5: ERPNext Deployment & Validation (Technical POCs)

**Goal:** Get hands-on with ERPNext to validate research

**Prerequisites:** Phases 1.1-1.4 complete (research done first!)

**Technical Tasks:**

**Deploy ERPNext Dev Instance:**

```bash
# Using Frappe Docker with PostgreSQL
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker
cd frappe_docker
# Configure for PostgreSQL (not MariaDB)
# Point to Supabase test database
```

**ERPNext FSM Module Setup:**

- Configure FSM module
- Create test data representing FLRTS domain
- Test actual DocTypes we identified in research
- User roles configured (admin, supervisor, worker)

**API Testing:**

```bash
# Test ERPNext REST API
# Endpoints to validate:
#   - GET /api/resource/Location
#   - POST /api/resource/Work Order
#   - GET /api/resource/Supplier
#   - Webhooks configuration
```

**Integration POCs:**

```python
# Telegram Bot â†’ ERPNext POC
# Simple bot that creates work order via API

# n8n Workflow â†’ ERPNext POC
# Workflow triggered by ERPNext webhook
```

**Deliverables:**

- ERPNext dev instance running on PostgreSQL
- Test data in ERPNext FSM module
- Postman collection with API calls tested
- API performance benchmarks (< 200ms target)
- Telegram bot POC creating ERPNext work orders
- n8n workflow POC triggered by ERPNext webhooks

#### 1.6: Schema Mapping Document (Based on Research)

**Goal:** Map FLRTS requirements â†’ ERPNext DocTypes

**Prerequisites:** All research complete (1.1-1.4)

**Approach:** Use functional requirements (not current schema!) to map to
ERPNext

```markdown
# FLRTS â†’ ERPNext Schema Mapping

## Based on Functional Requirements (Not Current Schema)

| Business Entity | Functional Needs              | ERPNext DocType    | Customization Needed |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Sites/Locations | Name, code, aliases, location | tabLocation        | Add custom fields    |
| Contractors     | Name, contact, sites assigned | tabSupplier        | Add custom fields    |
| Personnel       | Telegram ID, roles, timezone  | tabUser + custom   | Custom DocType?      |
| Work            | Tasks, subtasks, checklists   | tabWork Order      | Child tables         |
| Lists           | Shopping, checklists, etc     | tabToDo OR custom  | TBD based on needs   |
| Reminders       | Due dates, recurring          | tabEvent OR custom | TBD based on needs   |

## Migration Strategy per Entity

**Sites:** Direct mapping to tabLocation + custom fields **Contractors:** Direct
mapping to tabSupplier + custom fields **Personnel:** Custom DocType extending
tabUser (Telegram integration) **Work:** Use tabWork Order + child tables for
subtasks/checklists **Lists/Reminders:** Evaluate if ERPNext modules sufficient
OR keep custom tables in public schema
```

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/migration/schema-mapping.md`
  - Complete mapping based on functional requirements
  - Justification for each mapping decision
  - Identified gaps requiring custom DocTypes
- **Document:** `docs/migration/data-migration-strategy.md`
  - Strategy for migrating each entity
  - Whether to use ERPNext import OR direct SQL
  - Estimated migration time and complexity

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**

### Phase 2: Data Migration Planning & Custom DocType Design (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Design custom DocTypes and plan data transformation WITHOUT touching
production

**Prerequisites:**

- Phase 1 complete and approved
- Go decision made
- Functional requirements and schema mapping finalized

**Philosophy:** Design ERPNext schema extensions thoughtfully. Understand what
data transforms are needed.

**Linear Stories to Create:**

- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Design custom DocTypes for FLRTS-specific entities
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Create DocType JSON definitions
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Audit production data quality and transformation needs
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Design data transformation logic (not just copying data)
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Write and test data migration scripts
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Create data validation and rollback procedures

#### 2.1: Custom DocType Design

**Goal:** Design DocTypes for entities not covered by standard ERPNext

**Based on Phase 1 Schema Mapping:**

1. **Review Gaps from Schema Mapping:**
   - Which FLRTS entities need custom DocTypes?
   - Which can use standard ERPNext DocTypes + custom fields?
   - Which might stay as custom tables in `public` schema?

2. **Design Custom DocTypes:**
   - **Example: FLRTS Personnel DocType**
     - Extends standard User with:
     - Telegram user ID (Link field)
     - Telegram username
     - Phone with country code
     - Timezone (for scheduling)
     - FLRTS role (different from ERPNext roles)
     - Metadata (JSONB for extensibility)

3. **Create DocType JSON Definitions:**

   ```json
   // Example: FLRTS Personnel.json
   {
     "name": "FLRTS Personnel",
     "module": "FLRTS",
     "istable": 0,
     "fields": [
       {
         "fieldname": "telegram_user_id",
         "fieldtype": "Data",
         "label": "Telegram User ID",
         "unique": 1,
         "reqd": 1
       }
       // ... more fields
     ]
   }
   ```

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/migration/custom-doctypes-design.md`
  - Rationale for each custom DocType
  - Field-by-field definitions
  - Relationships and links to standard DocTypes
- **Files:** `erpnext-customizations/doctypes/*.json`
  - JSON definitions for each custom DocType
  - Ready to import into ERPNext
- **Document:** `docs/migration/custom-fields-standard-doctypes.md`
  - Custom fields to add to standard DocTypes (Location, Supplier, Work Order)

#### 2.2: Production Data Audit & Transformation Design

**Goal:** Understand data quality and transformation needs

**Data Audit:**

```sql
-- Count records and identify data quality issues
SELECT 'sites' AS table_name, COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE name IS NULL) as null_names,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE code IS NULL) as null_codes
FROM public.sites;

-- Check for data that doesn't fit ERPNext constraints
-- e.g., duplicate codes, invalid references, etc.
```

**Transformation Analysis:**

1. **Not Just Copying Data:**
   - What data needs cleaning before migration?
   - What data needs transformation (format changes)?
   - What data needs enrichment (adding required ERPNext fields)?

2. **Examples of Transformations:**
   - **Sites â†’ Location:**
     - Transform `aliases` array to ERPNext format
     - Map FLRTS location JSONB to ERPNext address fields
     - Generate ERPNext naming series
   - **Tasks â†’ Work Order:**
     - Map FLRTS status strings to ERPNext workflow states
     - Transform metadata JSONB to ERPNext custom fields
     - Create child table records for subtasks

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/migration/data-audit-report.md`
  - Record counts per table
  - Data quality issues identified
  - Missing/invalid data flagged for cleanup
- **Document:** `docs/migration/data-transformation-logic.md`
  - Detailed transformation rules for each entity type
  - Mapping of FLRTS fields â†’ ERPNext fields
  - Data enrichment requirements
  - Edge cases and how to handle them

#### 2.3: Migration Scripts Development

**Goal:** Write scripts that TRANSFORM data, not just copy it

**Approach:** Use ERPNext Data Import API + custom transformation logic

```python
# Example: migrate_sites_to_locations.py

from frappe.client import FrappeClient
import json

def transform_flrts_site_to_location(site_data):
    """
    Transform FLRTS site data to ERPNext Location format.

    Handles:
    - Aliases array â†’ ERPNext custom field
    - JSONB location â†’ Address fields
    - Code generation for ERPNext naming series
    """
    location = {
        "doctype": "Location",
        "location_name": site_data["name"],
        "custom_flrts_code": site_data["code"],
        "custom_aliases": json.dumps(site_data["aliases"]),
        # ... transformation logic
    }

    # Validate before returning
    validate_location_data(location)
    return location

def migrate_sites_batch(sites, erpnext_client):
    """Migrate sites in batches with error handling."""
    for site in sites:
        try:
            location = transform_flrts_site_to_location(site)
            erpnext_client.insert("Location", location)
        except Exception as e:
            log_migration_error(site, e)
            # Continue or abort based on error severity
```

**Deliverables:**

- **Scripts:** `migration-scripts/migrate_*.py` for each entity type
  - Sites â†’ Locations
  - Contractors â†’ Suppliers
  - Personnel â†’ Users + custom DocType
  - Tasks â†’ Work Orders
- **Scripts:** `migration-scripts/rollback_*.py` for rollback
- **Scripts:** `migration-scripts/validate_*.py` for data validation
- **Document:** `docs/migration/migration-scripts-guide.md`
  - How to run scripts
  - Order of execution
  - Error handling procedures

#### 2.4: Test Migration on Copy of Production

**Goal:** Validate migration process without risk

**Test Environment Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Create Supabase branch or test database
# 2. Copy production data to test database
# 3. Point ERPNext dev instance to test database
# 4. Run migration scripts
# 5. Validate results
# 6. Test API access and integrations
# 7. Measure performance
```

**Validation Procedures:**

```sql
-- Compare record counts before/after
SELECT
  'sites' as entity,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.sites) as source_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tabLocation WHERE custom_flrts_code IS NOT NULL) as target_count;

-- Validate data integrity (spot checks)
-- Validate relationships (FKs equivalent)
-- Validate custom field data
```

**Deliverables:**

- Test migration executed successfully
- **Document:** `docs/migration/test-migration-report.md`
  - Results of test migration
  - Record counts comparison (source vs target)
  - Data integrity validation results
  - Issues found and resolution plan
  - Performance metrics (migration time, data volume)
- **Document:** `docs/migration/rollback-procedure.md`
  - Step-by-step rollback instructions
  - Tested and validated rollback process

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**

- [ ] **Custom DocTypes Designed:**
  - [ ] All custom DocTypes designed with field-level detail
  - [ ] DocType JSON definitions created
  - [ ] Custom fields for standard DocTypes documented
- [ ] **Data Understanding:**

  - [ ] Rollback scripts created and tested
  - [ ] Validation scripts created
  - [ ] Test migration successful (0 data loss)
  - [ ] All deliverable documents created and reviewed
  - [ ] Migration time acceptable (< 1 hour estimate)

**Rollback:** Keep current schema, abort migration (medium cost - significant
planning investment)

---

### Phase 3: Code Migration Planning & API Client Development (Week 5-6)

**Goal:** Plan ALL code changes systematically and build foundation (API client)
BEFORE touching integration code

**Prerequisites:**

- Phase 2 complete
- Custom DocTypes deployed to dev ERPNext
- Migration scripts validated

**Philosophy:** Use the codebase audit from Phase 1.4. Don't start changing
integration code until API client is solid.

**Linear Stories to Create:**

- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Create ERPNext API client library (foundation first!)
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Plan sync-service code changes (based on audit)
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Plan Telegram bot code changes (based on audit)
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Plan n8n workflow changes (based on audit)
- [ ] `10N-XXX`: Create integration testing suite for ERPNext

#### 3.1: ERPNext API Client Library Development

**Goal:** Build robust, well-tested API client BEFORE using it anywhere

**Why First:** Foundation for all other integrations. Get this right, everything
else is easier.

**Design Considerations:**

1. **Type Safety:**
   - TypeScript types for all ERPNext DocTypes
   - Leverage Phase 2 custom DocType definitions
   - Generate types from DocType JSON if possible

2. **Error Handling:**
   - ERPNext-specific error codes
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Circuit breaker for API health

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - Intuitive API methods
   - Good documentation
   - Comprehensive test coverage

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// packages/erpnext-client/src/index.ts

export class ERPNextClient {
  private baseURL: string;
  private apiKey: string;
  private apiSecret: string;

  constructor(config: ERPNextConfig) {
    this.baseURL = config.url;
    this.apiKey = config.apiKey;
    this.apiSecret = config.apiSecret;
  }

  // Work Order operations
  async createWorkOrder(data: WorkOrderInput): Promise<WorkOrder> {
    return this.post(
      '/api/resource/Work Order',
      this.transformWorkOrderInput(data)
    );
  }

  async getWorkOrder(id: string): Promise<WorkOrder> {
    return this.get(`/api/resource/Work Order/${id}`);
  }

  async updateWorkOrder(
    id: string,
    data: Partial<WorkOrderInput>
  ): Promise<WorkOrder> {
    return this.put(`/api/resource/Work Order/${id}`, data);
  }

  // Location operations
  async createLocation(data: LocationInput): Promise<Location> {
    return this.post('/api/resource/Location', data);
  }

  async getLocations(filters?: LocationFilters): Promise<Location[]> {
    return this.get('/api/resource/Location', { filters });
  }

  // Supplier operations (contractors)
  async createSupplier(data: SupplierInput): Promise<Supplier> {
    return this.post('/api/resource/Supplier', data);
  }

  // Custom FLRTS Personnel DocType
  async createFLRTSPersonnel(
    data: FLRTSPersonnelInput
  ): Promise<FLRTSPersonnel> {
    return this.post('/api/resource/FLRTS Personnel', data);
  }

  // Webhook management
  async registerWebhook(event: string, url: string): Promise<void> {
    // ERPNext webhook registration
  }

  // Private helper methods
  private async get<T>(endpoint: string, params?: any): Promise<T> {
    // HTTP GET with auth, error handling, retries
  }

  private async post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<T> {
    // HTTP POST with auth, error handling, retries
  }

  private transformWorkOrderInput(input: WorkOrderInput): ERPNextWorkOrder {
    // Transform FLRTS format to ERPNext format
    // Handle field name differences, required fields, etc.
  }
}

// Type definitions
export interface WorkOrderInput {
  subject: string;
  location: string;
  assigned_to?: string;
  description?: string;
  due_date?: string;
  priority?: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' | 'Urgent';
}

export interface WorkOrder {
  name: string; // ERPNext ID
  subject: string;
  status: string;
  location: string;
  // ... all ERPNext Work Order fields
}

// ... more type definitions
```

**Deliverables:**

- **Package:** `packages/erpnext-client/`
  - Fully typed TypeScript client
  - Comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage)
  - Integration tests against dev ERPNext instance
  - API documentation (JSDoc + README)
  - Example usage scripts
- **Document:** `docs/development/erpnext-client-api.md`
  - API reference for developers
  - Common usage patterns
  - Error handling guide

#### 3.2: Integration Code Change Planning

**Goal:** Create detailed migration plans for each integration (DON'T code yet!)

**Use Phase 1.4 Codebase Audit:**

For each module identified in audit:

1. **Review Audit Report:**
   - Files to modify
   - Functions to update
   - APIs to replace
   - Tests to update

2. **Create Detailed Migration Plan:**
   - Step-by-step changes for each file
   - Dependencies between changes (what must come first?)
   - Testing strategy for each change
   - Rollback strategy

3. **Identify Risks:**
   - What could break?
   - What's the blast radius?
   - How to mitigate?

**Example: sync-service Migration Plan**

```markdown
### sync-service Migration to ERPNext

**Files to Modify:**

1. `packages/sync-service/src/index.ts`
   - **Lines 45-67:** Replace OpenProject client initialization with
     ERPNextClient
   - **Lines 89-102:** Replace OpenProject webhook handlers with ERPNext webhook
     handlers
   - **Dependencies:** Must complete 3.1 (API client) first
   - **Testing:** Integration tests with dev ERPNext instance
   - **Risk:** High - core service functionality
   - **Rollback:** Feature flag to switch between OpenProject and ERPNext

2. `packages/sync-service/src/config.ts`
   - **Lines 12-15:** Replace OPENPROJECT*\* env vars with ERPNEXT*\*
   - **Dependencies:** None
   - **Testing:** Config validation tests
   - **Risk:** Low
   - **Rollback:** Keep old env vars until migration complete

**New Files to Create:**

1. `packages/sync-service/src/erpnext-sync.ts`
   - Purpose: ERPNext-specific sync logic
   - Functions:
     - `syncWorkOrderToSupabase()` - Cache work orders in Supabase
     - `handleERPNextWebhook()` - Process ERPNext webhooks
     - `transformERPNextToFLRTS()` - Data transformation layer
   - Testing: Unit tests + integration tests
   - Risk: Medium - new code, potential bugs

**Migration Steps (in order):**

1. Add ERPNext env vars (keep OpenProject vars)
2. Create erpnext-sync.ts module
3. Write tests for erpnext-sync.ts
4. Add feature flag to switch backends
5. Update index.ts to use ERPNext when flag enabled
6. Test with feature flag OFF (should still use OpenProject)
7. Test with feature flag ON (should use ERPNext)
8. Fix any issues
9. Enable feature flag in dev environment
10. Monitor for 1 week
11. Enable in production
12. Remove OpenProject code after 30 days

**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours **Risk Level:** High **Dependencies:** ERPNext
client (3.1), Custom DocTypes deployed (Phase 2)
```

**Deliverables:**

- **Document:** `docs/migration/sync-service-migration-plan.md`
- **Document:** `docs/migration/telegram-bot-migration-plan.md`
- **Document:** `docs/migration/n8n-workflows-migration-plan.md`
- Each with:
  - Detailed step-by-step changes
  - Testing strategy
  - Risk assessment
  - Rollback procedures
  - Effort estimates

#### 3.3: Integration Testing Suite Development

**Goal:** Build comprehensive integration tests BEFORE changing any integration
code

**Test Scenarios:**

```typescript
// tests/integration/erpnext-integration.test.ts

describe('ERPNext Integration Suite', () => {
  describe('Telegram Bot â†’ ERPNext', () => {
    it('creates work order from Telegram message', async () => {
      // Simulate Telegram message
      // Verify work order created in ERPNext
      // Verify notification sent back to Telegram
    });
  });

  describe('ERPNext â†’ n8n Webhooks', () => {
    it('triggers n8n workflow on work order creation', async () => {
      // Create work order in ERPNext
      // Verify n8n webhook received
      // Verify workflow executes correctly
    });
  });

  describe('Sync Service', () => {
    it('syncs ERPNext work orders to Supabase cache', async () => {
      // Create work order in ERPNext
      // Verify synced to Supabase
      // Verify data transformation correct
    });
  });

  describe('End-to-End Flow', () => {
    it('complete flow: Telegram â†’ ERPNext â†’ n8n â†’ Notification', async () => {
      // Full integration test
    });
  });
});
```

**Deliverables:**

- **Test Suite:** `tests/integration/erpnext-integration.test.ts`

discovered OpenProject is not designed for field service operations. ERPNext
provides native FSM features, better extensibility, and same PostgreSQL/Supabase
compatibility.

**Related ADR:** ADR-006

**Phases:**

1. Research & Validation (2 weeks)
2. Schema Migration Planning (1 week)
3. Integration Code Updates (2 weeks)
4. Custom UI Development (3 weeks) [Optional]
5. Production Deployment (1 week)

**Success Criteria:**

- ERPNext deployed and integrated
- All FLRTS features working on ERPNext backend
- Telegram bot creates ERPNext work orders
- n8n workflows use ERPNext webhooks
- Custom dashboard (if built) uses ERPNext API
- Zero data loss during migration
```

**Child Stories:** All Phase 1-5 stories listed above
