# UI2 Future Integration Plan

## Overview
The `ui2/` directory contains the UI2 framework (https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/ui2), which will be used post-MVP for natural language interface capabilities.

## Purpose
UI2 allows users to input natural language commands that are internally categorized and processed to decide which tools or JSON schemas to use for creating UI elements. For our FLRTS application, this will be adapted to:

- Accept natural language input from users
- Parse and categorize the intent
- Generate appropriate JSON schemas 
- Create CRUD events on FLRTS items (instead of UI elements)

## Key Example
The todo-list example (`ui2/examples/todo-list/`) demonstrates the core functionality we'll adapt:
- Natural language input processing
- Intent categorization 
- Schema-based output generation
- Dynamic action execution

## Implementation Timeline
- **Current MVP**: Not used
- **Post-MVP**: Integrate for enhanced natural language processing of task/project management commands

## Status
- **Preserved**: Entire ui2/ directory maintained for future development
- **Documentation**: This file created during repository cleanup (2024-01-09)
