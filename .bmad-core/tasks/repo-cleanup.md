# Repository Cleanup and Documentation Schema Enforcement

## Task Overview
Execute comprehensive repository cleanup and documentation structure validation to maintain project hygiene and enforce organizational standards.

## Prerequisites
- QA agent access to repository structure
- Understanding of project documentation standards
- Access to file system operations

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation Structure Validation
1. **Verify Documentation Hierarchy**
   ```bash
   # Check required documentation structure exists
   - /docs/README.md (project overview)
   - /docs/architecture/ (system design)
   - /docs/stories/ (user stories)
   - /docs/qa/gates/ (quality gates)
   - /docs/processes/ (development processes)
   ```

2. **Validate Story Files Schema**
   - Check all story files follow template structure
   - Verify required sections present: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Agent Record, QA Results
   - Flag any stories missing critical sections

3. **Quality Gate File Validation**
   - Verify gate files follow YAML schema
   - Check gate files have corresponding story files
   - Flag orphaned or incomplete gate files

### Phase 2: Stale File Detection and Removal
1. **Identify Temporary Files**
   ```bash
   # Find and flag for removal:
   - *.tmp files
   - *_backup files  
   - *_old files
   - Files in /scratch/ older than 30 days
   - Duplicate documentation files
   ```

2. **Clean Development Artifacts**
   ```bash
   # Remove or relocate:
   - Test scripts not in /tests/
   - One-off migration scripts
   - Experimental code files (e.g., script_v2.py)
   - Unused configuration files
   ```

### Phase 3: Naming Convention Enforcement
1. **File Naming Standards**
   - Story files: `{epic}.{story}.{slug}.md`
   - Gate files: `{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
   - Architecture docs: kebab-case with descriptive names
   - Process docs: Clear, action-oriented names

2. **Directory Structure Validation**
   - Ensure logical grouping of related files
   - Verify consistent naming patterns within directories
   - Flag misplaced files (e.g., stories in wrong directories)

### Phase 4: Content Quality Checks
1. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Check for placeholder text or TODO markers
   - Verify all external references are valid
   - Ensure consistent formatting and structure

2. **Link Validation**
   - Verify internal document links work
   - Check external URLs are accessible
   - Flag broken or outdated references

### Phase 5: Automated Fixes
1. **Safe Automated Corrections**
   - Fix common formatting issues
   - Standardize file headers and metadata
   - Update outdated boilerplate text

2. **Create Cleanup Report**
   ```yaml
   cleanup_report:
     files_removed: []
     files_moved: []
     issues_found: []
     fixes_applied: []
     manual_review_required: []
   ```

## Quality Standards
- **Documentation Coverage**: All active features must have corresponding documentation
- **File Organization**: No orphaned or misplaced files
- **Naming Consistency**: All files follow established naming conventions
- **Content Quality**: No placeholder text in production documentation

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All documentation follows established schema
- [ ] No stale or temporary files remain in main directories  
- [ ] File naming conventions enforced consistently
- [ ] Broken links identified and flagged for repair
- [ ] Cleanup report generated with actions taken
- [ ] Manual review items clearly documented

## Output Deliverables
1. **Cleanup Execution Report**: Detailed log of all actions taken
2. **Issues Requiring Manual Review**: List of problems needing human intervention  
3. **Documentation Health Score**: Overall assessment of repository organization
4. **Recommendations**: Suggestions for preventing future organizational drift

## Safety Protocols
- **Backup Before Delete**: Create backup of any files before removal
- **User Confirmation**: Require confirmation before deleting non-temporary files
- **Rollback Plan**: Document how to undo all automated changes
- **Audit Trail**: Log all file operations for accountability

This task ensures repository maintains professional organization standards while preventing documentation sprawl and technical debt accumulation.
